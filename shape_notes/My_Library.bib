  abstract = {The adhesion and engulfment of nanoparticles by biomembranes is essential for many processes such as biomedical imaging, drug delivery, nanotoxicity, and viral infection. Many studies have shown that both surface chemistry, which determines the adhesive strength of the membrane√Äparticle interactions, and particle size represent key parameters for these processes. Here, we show that the asymmetry between the two leaflets of a bilayer membrane provides another key parameter for the engulfment of nanoparticles. The asymmetric membrane prefers to curve in a certain manner as quantitatively described by its spontaneous curvature. We derive two general relationships between particle size, adhesive strength, and spontaneous curvature that determine the instabilities of (i) the nonadhering or free state and (ii) the completely engulfed state of the particle. For model membranes such as lipid or polymer bilayers with a uniform composition, the two relationships lead to two critical particle sizes that determine four distinct engulfment regimes, both for the endocytic and for the exocytic engulfment process. For strong adhesion, the critical particle sizes are on the order of 10 nm, while they are on the order of 1000 nm for weak or ultraweak adhesion. Our theoretical results are therefore accessible to both experimental studies and computer simulations of model membranes. In order to address the more complex process of receptormediated endocytosis, we take the adhesion-induced segregation of membrane components into account and consider bound and unbound membrane segments that differ in their spontaneous curvatures. To model protein coats as formed during clathrin-dependent endocytosis, we focus on the case in which the bound membrane segments have a large spontaneous curvature compared to the unbound ones. We derive explicit expressions for the engulfment rate and the uptake of nanoparticles, which both depend on the particle size in a nonmonotonic manner, and provide a quantitative fit to experimental data for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of gold nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {We study the engulfment of solid particles by membranes with area reservoirs that are stabilized by large spontaneous curvature, and show that the properties of the reservoir can influence membrane remodelling processes.           ,              Biological cells are capable of undergoing extensive shape transformations thanks to the existence of membrane area reservoirs from which they can pull out membrane when required. A particularly relevant example of such membrane remodelling is given by endocytic and phagocytic processes, during which the cell membrane engulfs nano- and micrometer sized particles. Recently, it was shown that cell-like membrane reservoirs can be mimicked in giant vesicles with nanotubes stabilized by strong bilayer asymmetry, as quantified by the membrane's spontaneous curvature. Here, we theoretically investigate particle engulfment by such strongly-asymmetric membranes. We find that, depending on the sign of the spontaneous curvature, the engulfment transition may be continuous or discontinuous. Moreover, we find that, in the case of particle engulfment, the presence of asymmetry-stabilized reservoirs is not well captured by the constant-tension model typically used to describe cell-membrane deformations. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the nature of cellular membrane reservoirs, in order to accurately describe membrane remodelling processes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the interaction of 2D materials including graphene, boron nitride and MoS2 with biological systems is a growing topic of interest to many applications such as biosensors, drug delivery, gene therapy and nano-toxicity. In this paper, we show that the interaction of 2D materials with cellular membranes at its early stage of approaching is dominantly controlled by entropic forces. Recent experiments indicate that graphene sheets, depending on their size, can either undergo a near-orthogonal cutting or a parallel attachment mode of interaction with cell membranes. Here, we perform a set of integrated theoretical statistical mechanics analysis and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the entropic energy barrier for these modes of interactions. Our results indicate that micro-sized graphene sheets prefer approaching a fluctuating membrane through a sharp corner, while nano-sized sheets are more likely to adhere to the cell membrane surface due to relatively low entropic energy cost that is comparable with thermal energy from random Brownian motions.},

Two different methods that have given different results in the literature were then used to extract spectra from the emulated fluctuations that were then compared to the exact input spectra. A real space method shows systematic, but small deviations attributed to splines introducing an artifactual filter. A direct Fourier method obtains accurate results when the in-plane placement of the emulated particles is uncorrelated with the out-of-plane undulations, but systematic underestimates occur when the particle placement is more realistically correlated with the undulations. Although quantitative corrections cannot be estimated from our one-dimensional model, the results are qualitatively consistent with the direct Fourier method underestimating the 1/q2 spectral dependence that is characteristic of a tilt degree of freedom in simulations.},

Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.},

  abstract = {Several methods for preparing well equilibrated melts of long chains polymers are studied. We show that the standard method in which one starts with an ensemble of chains with the correct end-to-end distance arranged randomly in the simulation cell and introduces the excluded volume rapidly, leads to deformation on short length scales. This deformation is strongest for long chains and relaxes only after the chains have moved their own size. Two methods are shown to overcome this local deformation of the chains. One method is to first pre-pack the Gaussian chains, which reduces the density fluctuations in the system, followed by a gradual introduction of the excluded volume. The second method is a double-pivot algorithm in which new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the original. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods for a linear bead spring polymer model with both zero and nonzero bending stiffness, however the methods are applicable to more complex architectures such as branched and star polymer.},

Measurements of the interactions between two and three membrane deforming objects have revealed their non-additive nature. They are thought to lead to complex many-body effects, however, experimental evidence is lacking to date. We here present an experimental method to measure many-body effects in membrane-mediated interactions using colloidal spheres placed between a deflated giant unilamellar vesicles and a planar substrate. The thus confined colloidal particles cause a large deformation of the membrane while not being physochemically attached to it and interact through it. Two particles are found to attract with a maximum force of 0.2\textasciitilde pN. For three particles, we observe a preference for forming compact equilateral triangles over a linear arrangement. We use numerical energy minimization to establish that the attraction stems from a reduction in the membrane-deformation energy caused by the particles. Confining up to 36 particles, we find a preference for hexagonally close packed clusters. However, with increasing number of particles the order of the confined particles decreases, while at the same time, diffusivity of the particles increases. Our experiments for the first time show that the non-additive nature of membrane-mediated interactions affects the interactions and arrangements and ultimately leads to spherical aggregates with liquid-like order of potential importance for cellular processes.},

Our model has specific ligand-receptor interactions realized by mobile receptors on the vesicles and immobile ligands on the particles. Through a series of experiments, theory and molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify the wrapping process of anisotropic dumbbells by GUVs and identify distinct stages of the wrapping pathway. We find that the strong curvature variation in the neck of the dumbbell as well as membrane tension are crucial in determining both the speed of wrapping and the final states.},

  abstract = {This manuscript discusses basic methodological aspects of optical microscopy and micromanipulation methods to study membranes and reviews methods to generate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). In particular, we focus on the use of fluorescence microscopy and micropipet manipulation techniques to study composition‚Äìstructure‚Äìproperty materials relationships of free-standing lipid bilayer membranes. Because their size (‚àº5‚Äì100  m diameter) that is well above the resolution limit of regular light microscopes, GUVs are suitable membrane models for optical microscopy and micromanipulation experimentation. For instance, using different fluorescent reporters, fluorescence microscopy allows strategies to study membrane lateral structure/dynamics at the level of single vesicles of diverse compositions. The micropipet manipulation technique on the other hand, uses Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy and allows studies on the mechanical, thermal, molecular exchange and adhesive-interactive properties of compositionally different membranes under controlled environmental conditions. The goal of this review is to (i) provide a historical perspective for both techniques; (ii) present and discuss some of their most important contributions to our understanding of lipid bilayer membranes; and (iii) outline studies that would utilize both techniques simultaneously on the same vesicle thus bringing the ability to characterize structure and strain responses together with the direct application of well-defined stresses to a single membrane or observe the effects of adhesive spreading. Knowledge gained by these studies has informed several applications of lipid membranes including their use as lung surfactants and drug delivery systems for cancer.},

  abstract = {Besides direct particle‚àíparticle interactions, nanoparticles adsorbed to biomembranes experience indirect interactions that are mediated by the membrane curvature arising from particle adsorption. In this Letter, we show that the curvature-mediated interactions of adsorbed Janus particles depend on the initial curvature of the membrane prior to adsorption, that is, on whether the membrane initially bulges toward or away from the particles in our simulations. The curvature-mediated interaction can be strongly attractive for Janus particles adsorbed to the outside of a membrane vesicle, which initially bulges away from the particles. For Janus particles adsorbed to the vesicle inside, in contrast, the curvature-mediated interactions are repulsive. We find that the area fraction of the adhesive Janus particle surface is an important control parameter for the curvature-mediated interaction and assembly of the particles, besides the initial membrane curvature.},

  abstract = {Intact-organism imaging of Drosophila larvae reveals and quantifies chromatinaqueous phase separation. The chromatin can be organized near the lamina layer of the nuclear envelope, conventionally fill the nucleus, be organized centrally, or as a wetting droplet. These transitions are controlled by changes in nuclear volume and the interaction of chromatin with the lamina (part of the nuclear envelope) at the nuclear periphery. Using a simple polymeric model that includes the key features of chromatin self-attraction and its binding to the lamina, we demonstrate theoretically that it is the competition of these two effects that determines the mode of chromatin distribution. The qualitative trends as well as the composition profiles obtained in our simulations compare well with the observed intact-organism imaging and quantification. Since the simulations contain only a small number of physical variables we can identify the generic mechanisms underlying the changes in the observed phase separations.},

  abstract = {One of the major challenges of bottom-up synthetic biology is rebuilding a minimal cell division machinery. From a reconstitution perspective, the animal cell division apparatus is mechanically the simplest and therefore attractive to rebuild. An actin-based ring produces contractile force to constrict the membrane. By contrast, microbes and plant cells have a cell wall, so division requires concerted membrane constriction and cell wall synthesis. Furthermore, reconstitution of the actin division machinery helps in understanding the physical and molecular mechanisms of cytokinesis in animal cells and thus our own cells. In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art research on reconstitution of minimal actin-mediated cytokinetic machineries. Based on the conceptual requirements that we obtained from the physics of the shape changes involved in cell division, we propose two major routes for building a minimal actin apparatus capable of division. Importantly, we acknowledge both the passive and active roles that the confining lipid membrane can play in synthetic cytokinesis. We conclude this review by identifying the most pressing challenges for future reconstitution work, thereby laying out a roadmap for building a synthetic cell equipped with a minimal actin division machinery.},

  abstract = {Temperature control algorithms in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are necessary to study isothermal systems. However, these thermostatting algorithms alter the velocities of the particles and thus modify the dynamics of the system with respect to the microcanonical ensemble, which could potentially lead to thermostat-dependent dynamical artifacts. In this study, we investigate how six well-established thermostat algorithms applied with different coupling strengths and to different degrees of freedom affect the dynamics of various molecular systems. We consider dynamic processes occurring on different times scales by measuring translational and rotational self-diffusion as well as the shear viscosity of water, diffusion of a small molecule solvated in water, and diffusion and the dynamic structure factor of a polymer chain in water. All of these properties are significantly dampened by thermostat algorithms which randomize particle velocities, such as the Andersen thermostat and Langevin dynamics, when strong coupling is used. For the solvated small molecule and polymer, these dampening effects are reduced somewhat if the thermostats are applied to the solvent alone, such that the solute‚Äôs temperature is maintained only through thermal contact with solvent particles. Algorithms which operate by scaling the velocities, such as the Berendsen thermostat, the stochastic velocity rescaling approach of Bussi and co-workers, and the Nose-ÃÅ Hoover thermostat, yield transport properties that are statistically indistinguishable from those of the microcanonical ensemble, provided they are applied globally, i.e. coupled to the system‚Äôs kinetic energy. When coupled to local kinetic energies, a velocity scaling thermostat can have dampening effects comparable to a velocity randomizing method, as we observe when a massive Nose-Hoover coupling scheme is used to simulate water. Correct dynamical properties, at least those studied in this paper, are obtained with the Berendsen thermostat applied globally, despite the fact that it yields the wrong kinetic energy distribution.},

  abstract = {The importance of curvature as a structural feature of biological membranes has been recognized for many years and has fascinated scientists from a wide range of different backgrounds. On the one hand, changes in membrane morphology are involved in a plethora of phenomena involving the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, including endo- and exocytosis, phagocytosis and filopodia formation. On the other hand, a multitude of intracellular processes at the level of organelles rely on generation, modulation, and maintenance of membrane curvature to maintain the organelle shape and functionality. The contribution of biophysicists and biologists is essential for shedding light on the mechanistic understanding and quantification of these processes. Given the vast complexity of phenomena and mechanisms involved in the coupling between membrane shape and function, it is not always clear in what direction to advance to eventually arrive at an exhaustive understanding of this important research area. The 2018 Biomembrane Curvature and Remodeling Roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity and is intended to provide guidance both for students who have just entered the field as well as established scientists who would like to improve their orientation within this fascinating area.},

These extensions incorporate the reference state and non-local energy to account for the spontaneous curvature, bilayer coupling, and area-difference elasticity models. Our results indicate that the proposed extensions enhance the schemes to account for shape transformation including budding/vesiculation as well as for non-axisymmetric shapes. We find that the extended scheme B is superior to the rest in terms of accuracy, and robustness as well as simplicity of implementation. We demonstrate the capabilities of this scheme on several benchmark problems including the budding-vesiculating process and the reproduction of the phase diagram of vesicles.},

To address the problem, we propose and successfully use a Ginzburg-Landau type of free energy, which allows us to uniquely describe without interruption the whole, full-scale topological change. We also compute the force fields needed to overcome the involved energy barriers. The obtained forces are in excellent agreement, in terms of intensity, scale, and spatial localization with experimental data on typical fission protein systems, whereas they suggest the presence of additional features in fusion proteins.},

Despite this, they are not well understood due to their multiscale nature, which limits the use of molecular models and calls for a mesoscopic approach such as the celebrated Canham‚ÄìHelfrich one. Unfortunately, such a model cannot handle topological transitions, hiding the crucial involved forces and the appearance of the experimentally observed hemifused intermediates. In this work, we describe the membrane as a diffuse interface preserving the Canham‚ÄìHelfrich elasticity. We show that pivotal features of the hemifusion pathway are captured by this mesoscopic approach, e.g. a (meta)stable hemifusion state and the fusogenic behavior of negative monolayer spontaneous curvatures. The membrane lateral stress profile is calculated as a function of the elastic rigidities, yielding a coarse-grained version of molecular models findings. Insights into the fusogenic mechanism are reported and discussed.},

In eukaryotic cells, membrane fusion and fission are often catalyzed by large GTPases of the dynamin protein family. These proteins couple GTP hydrolysis to membrane deformation, which eventually leads to fusion or fission of the lipid bilayer. Mutations in eukaryotic dynamin-like proteins (DLPs) are associated with various diseases underscoring the importance to fully understand the biochemistry of these proteins. In recent years, a wealth of structural and biochemical data have been published that allow a detailed analysis of how dynamins or DLPs modulate biological membranes. However, less is known about the function of bacterial DLPs, although structural data exist. This review summarizes current knowledge about bacterial dynamins and discusses structural and functional properties in comparison to their eukaryotic counterparts.},

We find that the fluctuation spectrum of motions perpendicular to the bilayer can be decomposed into just two parts: 1), a pure undulation spectrum proportional to q√Ä4 that dominates in the small-q regime; and 2), a molecular density structure factor contribution that dominates in the large-q regime. There is no need for a term proportional to q√Ä2 that has been postulated for protrusion fluctuations and that appeared to have been necessary to fit the spectrum for intermediate q. We suggest that earlier reports of such a term were due to the artifact of binning and smoothing in real space before obtaining the Fourier spectrum. The observability of an intermediate protrusion regime from the fluctuation spectrum is discussed based on measured and calculated material constants.},

  abstract = {Translational diffusion coefficients are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. Linear fits to mean squared displacement (MSD) curves have become the de facto standard, from simple liquids to complex biomacromolecules. Nonlinearities in MSD curves at short times are handled with a wide variety of ad hoc practices, such as partial and piece-wise fitting of the data. Here, we present a rigorous framework to obtain reliable estimates of the self-diffusion coefficient and its statistical uncertainty. We also assess in a quantitative manner if the observed dynamics is, indeed, diffusive. By accounting for correlations between MSD values at different times, we reduce the statistical uncertainty of the estimator and, thereby, increase its efficiency. With a Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test, we check for possible anomalous diffusion. We provide an easy-to-use Python data analysis script for the estimation of self-diffusion coefficients. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to molecular dynamics simulation data of pure TIP4P-D water and a single ubiquitin protein. In another paper [S. von B√ºlow, J. T. Bullerjahn, and G. Hummer, J. Chem.

The dynamin superfamily is not restricted to eukaryotes but might have a bacterial origin, with many species containing an operon of two genes related to mitofusins. However, it is not clear whether bacterial dynamins promote membrane fission or fusion. The dynamin-like protein DynA of Bacillus subtilis is remarkable in that it arose from a gene fusion of two dynamins and contains two separate dynamin-like subunits and GTPase domains. We found that DynA exhibits strictly auto-regulated GTP hydrolysis, and that progress through the GTPase cycle is concerted within DynA oligomers. Furthermore, we show that DynA can tether membranes and mediates nucleotide-independent membrane fusion in vitro. This process merely requires magnesium as a cofactor. Our results provide a set of minimal requirements for membrane fusion by dynamin-like proteins and have mechanistic implications in particular for the fusion of mitochondria.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale physics bridges the gap between the microscopic degrees of freedom of a system and its large‚Äëscale continuous behavior and highlights the role of a few key quantities in complex and multiscale phenomena, like dynamin‚Äëdriven fission of lipid membranes. The dynamin protein wraps the neck formed during clathrin‚Äëmediated endocytosis, for instance, and constricts it until severing occurs. Although ubiquitous and fundamental for life, the cooperation between the GTP‚Äëconsuming conformational changes within the protein and the full‚Äëscale response of the underlying lipid substrate is yet to be unraveled. In this work, we build an effective mesoscopic model from constriction to fission of lipid tubules based on continuum membrane elasticity and implicitly accounting for ratchet‚Äëlike power strokes of dynamins. Localization of the fission event, the overall geometry, and the energy expenditure we predict comply with the major experimental findings. This bolsters the idea that a continuous picture emerges soon enough to relate dynamin polymerization length and membrane rigidity and tension with the optimal pathway to fission. We therefore suggest that dynamins found in in vivo processes may optimize their structure accordingly. Ultimately, we shed light on real‚Äëtime conductance measurements available in literature and predict the fission time dependency on elastic parameters.},

Bead models have usually been built in such a way that the beads fill the volume occupied by the particles. Sometimes the beads are few and of varying sizes (bead models in the strict sense), and other times there are many small beads (filling models). Because hydrodynamic friction takes place at the molecular surface, another possibility is to use shell models, as originally proposed by Bloomfield. In this work, we have developed procedures to build models of the various kinds, and we describe the theory and methods for calculating their hydrodynamic properties, including approximate methods that may be needed to treat models with a very large number of elements. By combining the various possibilities of model building and hydrodynamic calculation, several strategies can be designed. We have made a quantitative comparison of the performance of the various strategies by applying them to some test cases, for which the properties are known a priori. We provide guidelines and computational tools for bead modeling.},

Straightforward calculations based on the celebrated Canham-Helfrich elastic model predict a large topological energy barrier that prevents the fusion process from being thermally activated. On the one hand, such high energy is in accordance with the physical barrier function of lipid membranes, but, on the other hand, it is difficult to reconcile with the biological mechanisms involved in fusion processes.In this work, we use a Ginzburg-Landau type of free energy that recovers the Canham-Helfrich model in the limit of small width-to-vesicle-extension ratio, with the additional ability to handle topological transitions. We show that a local modification of the Gaussian modulus in the merging region both dramatically lowers the elastic energy barrier and substantially changes the minimal energy pathway for fusion, in accordance with experimental evidence. Therefore, we discuss biological examples in which such a modification might play a crucial role.},

This system contains two Min proteins, MinD and MinE, which periodically attach to and detach from the GUV membranes, with the detachment being driven by ATP hydrolysis. Here, we address these shape oscillations within the theoretical framework of curvature elasticity and show that they can be understood in terms of a spontaneous curvature that changes periodically with time. We focus on the simplest case provided by a attachment‚Äìdetachment kinetics that is laterally uniform along the membrane. During each oscillation cycle, the vesicle shape is transformed from a symmetric dumbbell with two subcompartments of equal size to an asymmetric dumbbell with two subcompartments of different size, followed by the reverse, symmetry-restoring transformation. This sequence of shapes is first analyzed within the spontaneous curvature model which is then extended to the area-difference-elasticity model by decomposing the spontaneous curvature into a local and nonlocal component. For both symmetric and asymmetric dumbbells, the two subcompartments are connected by a narrow membrane neck with a circular waistline. The radius of this waistline undergoes periodic oscillations, the time dependence of which can be reasonably well fitted by a single Fourier mode with an average time period of 56 s.},

The possibility of a eukaryote with a nitrogen-fixing organelle derived from endosymbiosis, which is called a nitroplast, has been speculated. Studying a marine alga with a cyanobacterial endosymbiont, Coale               et al               . used soft x-ray tomography to visualize cell morphology and division of the alga, revealing a coordinated cell cycle in which the endosymbiont divides and is split evenly, similar to the situation for plastids and mitochondria in these cells (see the Perspective by Massana). Proteomics revealed that a sizable fraction of the proteins in this structure are encoded by and imported from the alga, including many that are essential for biosynthesis, cell growth, and division. These results offer a fascinating view into the transition from an endosymbiont into a bona fide organelle. ‚ÄîMichael A. Funk},

To go from the molecular to the mesoscale, we notably appeal to physical renormalization arguments enabling us to rigorously infer the mesoscale interaction parameters from its molecular counterpart. We also explain how to deal with the physical timescales at stake at the mesoscale. Simulating the so-obtained mesoscale system enables us to equilibrate the long wavelengths of the vesicles of interest, up to the vesicle size. Conversely, we then backmap from the meso- to the nano- scale, which enables us to equilibrate in turn the short wavelengths down to the molecular length-scales. By applying our approach to the specific situation of the patterning of a vesicle membrane, we show that macroscopic membranes can thus be equilibrated at all length-scales in achievable computational time offering an original strategy to address the fundamental challenge of time scale in simulations of large bio-membrane systems.},

Although the heterogeneity of gRNA activity is well recognized, the current understanding of how CRISPR/Cas9 activity is regulated remains incomplete. Here, we identify a sweet spot range of binding free energy change for optimal efficiency which largely explains why gRNAs display changes in efficiency at on- and off-target sites, including why gRNAs can cleave an off-target with higher efficiency than the on-target. Using an energy-based model, we show that local gRNA-DNA interactions resulting from Cas9 ‚Äúsliding‚Äù on overlapping protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) profoundly impact gRNA activities. Combining the effects of local sliding for a given PAM context with global off-targets allows us to better identify highly specific, and thus efficient, gRNAs. We validate the effects of local sliding on gRNA efficiency using both public data and in-house data generated by measuring SpCas9 cleavage efficiency at 1024 sites designed to cover all possible combinations of 4-nt PAM and context sequences of 4 gRNAs. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of Cas9-PAM compatibility and cleavage activation, underlining the importance of accounting for local sliding in gRNA design.},

Computational models generally assume that contractile networks maintain constant total amounts of components, which is not always true. To test how compositional dynamics affect constriction kinetics, we first measured F-actin, non-muscle myosin II, septin, and anillin during Caenorhabditis elegans zygotic mitosis. A custom microfluidic device that positioned the cell with the division plane parallel to a light sheet allowed even illumination of the cytokinetic ring. Measured component abundances were implemented in a threedimensional agent-based model of a membrane-associated contractile ring. With constant network component amounts, constriction completed with biologically unrealistic kinetics. However, imposing the measured changes in component quantities allowed this model to elicit realistic constriction kinetics. Simulated networks were more sensitive to changes in motor and filament amounts than those of crosslinkers and tethers. Our findings highlight the importance of network composition for actomyosin contraction kinetics.},

  abstract = {Animal cells are both encapsulated and subdivided by lipid bilayer membranes. Beyond just acting as boundaries, these membranes‚Äô shapes influence the function of cells and their compartments. Physically, membranes are two-dimensional fluids with complex elastic behavior, which makes it impossible, for all but a few simple cases, to predict membrane shapes analytically. Instead, the shape and behavior of biological membranes can be determined by simulations. However, the setup and use of such simulations require a significant programming background. The availability of open-source and user-friendly packages for simulating biological membranes needs improvement. Here, we present flippy, an open-source package for simulating lipid membrane shapes, their interaction with proteins or external particles, and the effect of external forces. Our goal is to provide a tool that is easy to use without sacrificing performance or versatility. flippy is an implementation of a dynamically triangulated membrane. We use a precise yet fast algorithm for calculating the geometric properties of membranes and can also account for local spontaneous curvature, a feature not all discretizations allow. Finally, in flippy we can also include regions of purely elastic (non-fluid) membranes and thus explore various shapes encountered in living systems.},

  abstract = {Cellular membranes span a wide range of spatio-temporal scales from sub-microsecond dynamics of lipid molecules and intra-membrane proteins to multi-minute deformations of the whole cell. Since no single simulation method would cover all these scales, there exists a variety of membrane modeling techniques, each presenting unique advantages for addressing a diverse range of scientific questions. This review focuses on current advances in mesoscopic models that represent membranes as two-dimensional surfaces with selected mechanical properties. Two categories of approaches are considered, including fluid membrane (e.g., lipid bilayer) and polymerized membrane (e.g., red blood cell) models. Both particlebased and continuum models for these two classes of membranes are discussed. To illustrate the potential of these models, several examples from recent simulation studies are presented, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium membrane structures, membrane remodeling, and deformation in fluid flow. Finally, we briefly discuss further developments related to these membrane models.},

For the proposed Langevin-type equations, we construct a weak 2nd order geometric integrator that preserves the main geometric features of the continuous dynamics. The integrator uses Verlet-type splitting for the deterministic part of Langevin equations appropriately combined with an exactly integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

We formulate rotation using the quaternion representation of angular coordinates; both thermostats preserve the unit length of quaternions. The Langevin thermostat also ensures that the conjugate angular momenta stay within the tangent space of the quaternion coordinates, as required by the Hamiltonian dynamics of rigid bodies. We have constructed three geometric numerical integrators for the Langevin thermostat and one for the gradient thermostat. The numerical integrators reflect key properties of the thermostats themselves. Namely, they all preserve the unit length of quaternions, automatically, without the need of a projection onto the unit sphere. The Langevin integrators also ensure that the angular momenta remain within the tangent space of the quaternion coordinates. The Langevin integrators are quasi-symplectic and of weak order two. The numerical method for the gradient thermostat is of weak order one. Its construction exploits ideas of Lie-group type integrators for differential equations on manifolds. We numerically compare the discretization errors of the Langevin integrators, as well as the efficiency of the gradient integrator compared to the Langevin ones when used in the simulation of rigid TIP4P water model with smoothly truncated electrostatic interactions. We observe that the gradient integrator is computationally less efficient than the Langevin integrators. We also compare the relative accuracy of the Langevin integrators in evaluating various static quantities and give recommendations as to the choice of an appropriate integrator.},

We construct a system of overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion, and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of which ensure that the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing near a no-slip boundary and demonstrate the importance of the choice of tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near a bottom wall due to gravity. For several particle shapes, we find a choice of tracking point that makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method. However, in general, such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long time scales.},

  abstract = {A fluid lipid membrane transmits stresses and torques that are fully determined by its geometry. They can be described by a stress- and torque-tensor, respectively, which yield the force or torque per length through any curve drawn on the membrane‚Äôs surface. In the absence of external forces or torques the surface divergence of these tensors vanishes, revealing them as conserved quantities of the underlying Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation for the membrane‚Äôs shape. This review provides a comprehensive introduction into these concepts without assuming the reader‚Äôs familiarity with differential geometry, which instead will be developed as needed, relying on little more than vector calculus. The Helfrich Hamiltonian is then introduced and discussed in some depth. By expressing the quest for the energy-minimizing shape as a functional variation problem subject to geometric constraints, as proposed by Guven (2004), stress- and torque-tensors naturally emerge, and their connection to the shape equation becomes evident. How to reason with both tensors is then illustrated with a number of simple examples, after which this review concludes with four more sophisticated applications: boundary conditions for adhering membranes, corrections to the classical micropipette aspiration equation, membrane buckling, and membrane mediated interactions.},

  abstract = {Liposomes, self-assembled vesicles with a lipid-bilayer boundary similar to cell membranes, are extensively used in both fundamental and applied sciences. Manipulation of their physical properties, such as growth and division, may significantly expand their use as model systems in cellular and synthetic biology. Several approaches have been explored to controllably divide liposomes, such as shape transformation through temperature cycling, incorporation of additional lipids, and the encapsulation of protein division machinery. However, so far, these methods lacked control, exhibited low efficiency, and yielded asymmetric division in terms of volume or lipid composition. Here, we present a microfluidics-based strategy to realize mechanical division of cell-sized (‚àº6 Œºm) liposomes. We use octanolassisted liposome assembly (OLA) to produce liposomes on chip, which are subsequently flowed against the sharp edge of a wedge-shaped splitter. Upon encountering such a Y-shaped bifurcation, the liposomes are deformed and, remarkably, are able to divide into two stable daughter liposomes in just a few milliseconds. The probability of successful division is found to critically depend on the surface area-to-volume ratio of the mother liposome, which can be tuned through osmotic pressure, and to strongly correlate to the mother liposome size for given microchannel dimensions. The division process is highly symmetric (‚àº3\% size variation between the daughter liposomes) and is accompanied by a low leakage. This mechanical division of liposomes may constitute a valuable step to establish a growth-division cycle of synthetic cells.},

  abstract = {During cytokinesis, the cell undergoes a dramatic shape change as it divides into two daughter cells. Cell shape changes in cytokinesis are driven by a cortical ring rich in actin filaments and nonmuscle myosin II. The ring closes via actomyosin contraction coupled with actin depolymerization. Of interest, ring closure and hence the furrow ingression are nonconcentric (asymmetric) within the division plane across Metazoa. This nonconcentricity can occur and persist even without preexisting asymmetric cues, such as spindle placement or cellular adhesions. Cell-autonomous asymmetry is not explained by current models. We combined quantitative high-resolution live-cell microscopy with theoretical modeling to explore the mechanistic basis for asymmetric cytokinesis in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, with the goal of uncovering basic principles of ring closure. Our theoretical model suggests that feedback among membrane curvature, cytoskeletal alignment, and contractility is responsible for asymmetric cytokinetic furrowing. It also accurately predicts experimental perturbations of conserved ring proteins. The model further suggests that curvature-mediated filament alignment speeds up furrow closure while promoting energy efficiency. Collectively our work underscores the importance of membrane‚Äìcytoskeletal anchoring and suggests conserved molecular mechanisms for this activity.},

However, oftentimes, GUV morphologies and shape transitions are described qualitatively, which makes it difficult to quantitatively compare results from different studies and to advance precision engineering. Herein, open‚Äêsource software package GeoV for the 3D reconstruction and analysis of GUV shapes from confocal microscopy z‚Äêstacks is presented. The accuracy of the reconstruction by comparing the output for the Hausdorff distance of the surface, the curvature, and the bending energy to ground truth data for simulated shapes of different complexities is quantified. Next, GeoV on a variety of confocal microscopy datasets, including z‚Äêstacks from spherical GUVs and GUVs deformed with DNA origami, adherent GUVs, DNA droplets, and cells, is tested. Additionally, the effect of membrane‚Äêbinding DNA origami on the vesicle shape, volume, and bending energy is quantified. It is found that osmotic deflation and attachment of DNA origami can increase the bending energy of GUVs by a\,factor of 10. All in all, GeoV as an open‚Äêsource software package for the quantitative analysis of confocal microscopy data for bottom‚Äêup synthetic biology is provided.},

  abstract = {The elastic properties of lipid membranes can be measured by monitoring their thermal fluctuations. For instance, comparing the power spectra of membrane shape or lipid director fluctuations with predictions based on suitable continuum theories gives access to bending-, tilt-, and twist-moduli. However, to do so in a computer simulation, we must first define a continuum surface shape and lipid director field from the discrete configurations of lipid molecules in a typically fairly small box. Here, we show that the required mapping choices, as well as the details of the subsequent data analysis, can shift the measured values of these moduli by far more than their statistical uncertainties. We investigate the resulting systematic errors on the basis of atomistic simulation trajectories for 13 different lipids, previously published by Venable et al. [Chem. Phys. Lipids 192, 60‚Äì74 (2015)]. Specifically, we examine mapping choices for surface- and tilt-field definitions, normalizing and averaging lipid directors, accounting for wave vector dependent time autocorrelations, error propagation, and finding the right fitting range. We propose a set of criteria that may help to decide upon a particular combination of choices underlying the fluctuation analysis, and we make several recommendations based on these. While systematic shifts in observables that are extracted from large-wavelength limits vanish, in principle, for sufficiently large system size, no such exact limit exists for intrinsically local parameters, such as the twist modulus or the splay-tilt coupling, and so not all potential choices can be trivially verified.},

The surface tension and the bending modulus of the fluid membranes are extracted from the analysis of the spectrum of thermal undulations. At low area densities we observe the formation of pores in the membrane through which molecules can diffuse from one layer to the other.

  abstract = {Various models for lipid bilayer membranes have been presented to investigate their morphologies. Among them, the aggressive coarse-grained models, where the membrane is represented by a single layer of particles, are computationally efficient and of practical importance for simulating membrane dynamics at the microscopic scale. In these models, soft potentials between particle pairs are used to maintain the fluidity of membranes, but the underlying mechanism of the softening requires further clarification. We have analyzed the membrane area decrease due to thermal fluctuations, and the results demonstrate that the intraparticle part of entropic elasticity is responsible for the softening of the potential. Based on the stretching response of the membrane, a bottom-up model is developed with an entropic effect explicitly involved. The model reproduces several essential properties of the lipid membrane, including the fluid state and a plateau in the stretching curve. In addition, the area compressibility modulus, bending rigidity, and spontaneous curvature display linear dependence on model parameters. As a demonstration, we have investigated the closure and morphology evolution of membrane systems driven by spontaneous curvature, and vesicle shapes observed experimentally are faithfully reproduced.},

  abstract = {For a wide range of phenomena, current computational ability does not always allow for atomistic simulations of high-dimensional molecular systems to reach time scales of interest. Coarse-graining (CG) is an established approach to alleviate the impact of computational limits while retaining the same algorithms used in atomistic simulations. It is important to understand how algorithms such as Langevin integrators perform on non-trivial CG molecular systems, and in particular how large of an integration time step can be used without introducing unacceptable amounts of error into averaged quantities of interest. To investigate this, we examined three different Langevin integrators on a CG polymer melt: the recently developed BAOAB method by Leimkuhler and Matthews [J. Chem. Phys. 138 (17), 05B601\_1 (2013)], the Gr√∏nbech-Jensen and Farago method [Mol. Phys. 111 (8), 983-991 (2013)], or G-JF, and the frequently used Br√ºnger‚ÄìBrooks‚ÄìKarplus integrator [Chem. Phys. Lett. 105 (5), 495-500 (1984)], known as BBK. We compute and analyse key statistical properties for each. Our results indicate that the integrators perform similarly for a small friction parameter; however outside this regime, the use of large integration steps produces significant deviations from the predicted diffusivity and steady-state distributions for all methods examined with the exception of G-JF.},

Building upon the present biophysical and biochemical characterization of ABC transporters, we propose here a model whose solution reveals that these machines are an exact molecular realization of the autonomous Maxwell Demon, a century-old abstract device that uses an energy source to drive systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, the Maxwell Demon does not perform any direct mechanical work on the system, but simply selects which spontaneous processes to allow and which ones to forbid based on information that it collects and processes. In its autonomous version, the measurement device is embedded in the system itself. In the molecular model introduced here, the different operations that characterize Maxwell Demons (measurement, feedback, resetting) are features that emerge from the biochemical and structural properties of ABC transporters, revealing the crucial role of allostery to process information. Our framework allows us to develop an explicit bridge between the molecular-level description and the higher-level language of information theory for ABC transporters.},

Peripheral proteins that induce curvature in membranes (               e.g.               BAR domains) have been studied for a number of years. Little is known, however, about the effect of integral membrane proteins on the stiffness of a membrane (characterised by the bending rigidity,               K               c               ). We demonstrate by computer simulation that adding integral membrane proteins at physiological densities alters the stiffness of the membrane. First we establish that the coarse-grained MARTINI forcefield is able to accurately reproduce the bending rigidity of a small patch of 1500 phosphatidyl choline lipids by comparing the calculated value to both experiment and an atomistic simulation of the same system. This enables us to simulate the dynamics of large (               ca.               50\,000 lipids) patches of membrane using the MARTINI coarse-grained description. We find that altering the lipid composition changes the bending rigidity. Adding integral membrane proteins to lipid bilayers also changes the bending rigidity, whilst adding a simple peripheral membrane protein has no effect. Our results suggest that integral membrane proteins can have different effects, and in the case of the bacterial outer membrane protein, BtuB, the greater the density of protein, the larger the reduction in stiffness.},

Here, we review the state of the art in simulations of self-assembling bio-inspired supramolecular systems. We will first discuss progress in force fields, simulation protocols and enhanced sampling techniques using recent examples. Secondly, we will focus on efforts to enable the comparison of experimentally accessible observables and computational results. Experimental quantities that can be measured by microscopy, spectroscopy and scattering can be linked to simulation output either directly or indirectly,               via               quantum mechanical or semi-empirical techniques.

  abstract = {Lipid bilayer membranes have been extensively studied by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Numerical efficiencies have been reported in the cases of aggressive coarse-graining, where several lipids are coarse-grained into a particle of size 4 ‚àº 6 nm so that there is only one particle in the thickness direction. Yuan et al. proposed a pair-potential between these one-particle-thick coarse-grained lipid particles to capture the mechanical properties of a lipid bilayer membrane, such as gel‚Äìfluid‚Äìgas phase transitions of lipids, diffusion, and bending rigidity Yuan et al. (2010). In this work we implement such an interaction potential in LAMMPS to simulate large-scale lipid systems such as a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) and red blood cells (RBCs). We also consider the effect of cytoskeleton on the lipid membrane dynamics as a model for RBC dynamics, and incorporate coarse-grained water molecules to account for hydrodynamic interactions. The interaction between the coarse-grained water molecules (explicit solvent molecules) is modeled as a Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. To demonstrate that the proposed methods do capture the observed dynamics of vesicles and RBCs, we focus on two sets of LAMMPS simulations: 1. Vesicle shape transitions with enclosed volume; 2. RBC shape transitions with different enclosed volume. Finally utilizing the parallel computing capability in LAMMPS, we provide some timing results for parallel coarse-grained simulations to illustrate that it is possible to use LAMMPS to simulate large-scale realistic complex biological membranes for more than 1 ms.},

These features make critical Casimir forces excellent candidates for controlling the equilibrium and dynamical properties of individual colloids or colloidal dispersions as well as for possible applications in micro-mechanical systems.

  abstract = {Significance             Dynamin is a protein that is a central player in endocytosis, a process that mediates the entry of diverse particles into cells, from nutrients to viruses. Dynamin‚Äôs primary activity is to use guanosine triphosphate as fuel to constrict and cut membrane tubes. Key quantitative aspects of its function remain yet unclear. In this work, we determine the strength of an individual dynamin motor. Then, by building a detailed computational model resolving individual motors, we demonstrate that dynamin produces sufficient force to tightly constrict a membrane tube when most of its motors are simultaneously cooperating. Hence, we quantitatively validate the prevailing constriction-by-ratchet model for nature‚Äôs strongest torque-generating motor: the dynamin ‚Äúnanomuscle.‚Äù           ,              Dynamin oligomerizes into helical filaments on tubular membrane templates and, through constriction, cleaves them in a GTPase-driven way. Structural observations of GTP-dependent cross-bridges between neighboring filament turns have led to the suggestion that dynamin operates as a molecular ratchet motor. However, the proof of such mechanism remains absent. Particularly, it is not known whether a powerful enough stroke is produced and how the motor modules would cooperate in the constriction process. Here, we characterized the dynamin motor modules by single-molecule F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and found strong nucleotide-dependent conformational preferences. Integrating smFRET with molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to estimate the forces generated in a power stroke. Subsequently, the quantitative force data and the measured kinetics of the GTPase cycle were incorporated into a model including both a dynamin filament, with explicit motor cross-bridges, and a realistic deformable membrane template. In our simulations, collective constriction of the membrane by dynamin motor modules, based on the ratchet mechanism, is directly reproduced and analyzed. Functional parallels between the dynamin system and actomyosin in the muscle are seen. Through concerted action of the motors, tight membrane constriction to the hemifission radius can be reached. Our experimental and computational study provides an example of how collective motor action in megadalton molecular assemblies can be approached and explicitly resolved.},

Membrane‚Äêanchored FtsZ polymers are often regarded as a sufficient system to realize this chain of events. By using purified FtsZ and its membrane‚Äêbinding protein FtsA or the gain‚Äêof‚Äêfunction mutant FtsA* expressed in PURE (Protein synthesis Using Reconstituted Elements) from a DNA template, it is shown in this study that cytoskeletal structures are formed, and yield constricted liposomes exhibiting various morphologies. However, the resulting buds remain attached to the parental liposome by a narrow membrane neck. No division events can be monitored even after long‚Äêtime tracking by fluorescence microscopy, nor when the osmolarity of the external solution is increased. The results provide evidence that reconstituted FtsA‚ÄêFtsZ proto‚Äêrings coating the membrane necks are too stable to enable abscission. The prospect of combining a DNA‚Äêencoded FtsZ system with assisting mechanisms to achieve synthetic cell division is discussed.},

  abstract = {The fusion of lipid membranes progresses through a series of hemifusion intermediates with two significant energy barriers related to the formation of stalk and fusion pore, respectively. These energy barriers determine the speed and success rate of many critical biological processes, including the fusion of highly curved membranes, for example synaptic vesicles and enveloped viruses. Here we use continuum elastic theory of lipid monolayers to determine the relationship between membrane shape and energy barriers to fusion. We find that the stalk formation energy decreases with curvature by up to 31 kBT in a 20-nm-radius vesicle compared with planar membranes and by up to 8 kBT in the fusion of highly curved, long, tubular membranes. In contrast, the fusion pore formation energy barrier shows a more complicated behavior. Immediately after stalk expansion to the hemifusion diaphragm, the fusion pore formation energy barrier is low (15‚Äì25 kBT) due to lipid stretching in the distal monolayers and increased tension in highly curved vesicles. Therefore, the opening of the fusion pore is faster. However, these stresses relax over time due to lipid flip-flop from the proximal monolayer, resulting in a larger hemifusion diaphragm and a higher fusion pore formation energy barrier, up to 35 kBT. Therefore, if the fusion pore fails to open before significant lipid flip-flop takes place, the reaction proceeds to an extended hemifusion diaphragm state, which is a dead-end configuration in the fusion process and can be used to prevent viral infections. In contrast, in the fusion of long tubular compartments, the surface tension does not accumulate due to the formation of the diaphragm, and the energy barrier for pore expansion increases with curvature by up to 11 kBT. This suggests that inhibition of polymorphic virus infection could particularly target this feature of the second barrier.},

The shape and out-of-plane fluctuations of tensionless membranes are controlled by their bending rigidity. Due to their out-of-plane fluctuations, flexible membranes exhibit very different behaviour to flat two-dimensional systems. We discuss three properties of membranes: (i) the renormalization of the bending rigidity in fluid membranes due to undulations on short length scales; (ii) the suppression of the crystalline phase, and the hexatic-tofluid transition; and (iii) the lamellar-to-sponge transition in systems with variable topology. We focus on simulation studies, which are based on the numerical analysis of dynamically triangulated surface models.},

Active binding shifts its stability and makes the protein aggregates porous.           ,              The phase behavior of a membrane induced by the binding of curvature-inducing proteins is studied by a combination of analytical and numerical approaches. In thermal equilibrium under the detailed balance between binding and unbinding, the membrane exhibits three phases: an unbound uniform flat phase (U), a bound uniform flat phase (B), and a separated/corrugated phase (SC). In the SC phase, the bound proteins form hexagonally-ordered bowl-shaped domains. The transitions between the U and SC phases and between the B and SC phases are second order and first order, respectively. At a small spontaneous curvature of the protein or high surface tension, the transition between B and SC phases becomes continuous. Moreover, a first-order transition between the U and B phases is found at zero spontaneous curvature driven by the Casimir-like interactions between rigid proteins. Furthermore, nonequilibrium dynamics is investigated by the addition of active binding and unbinding at a constant rate. The active binding and unbinding processes alter the stability of the SC phase.},

  abstract = {Eukaryote cells have flexible membranes that allow them to have a variety of dynamical shapes. The shapes of the cells serve important biological functions, both for cells within an intact tissue, and during embryogenesis and cellular motility. How cells control their shapes and the structures that they form on their surface has been a subject of intensive biological research, exposing the building blocks that cells use to deform their membranes. These processes have also drawn the interest of theoretical physicists, aiming to develop models based on physics, chemistry and nonlinear dynamics. Such models explore quantitatively different possible mechanisms that the cells can employ to initiate the spontaneous formation of shapes and patterns on their membranes. We review here theoretical work where one such class of mechanisms was investigated: the coupling between curved membrane proteins, and the cytoskeletal forces that they recruit. Theory indicates that this coupling gives rise to a rich variety of membrane shapes and dynamics, while experiments indicate that this mechanism appears to drive many cellular shape changes.

The approach is a brute-force general representation of the Verlet-algorithm with free parameter coefficients that are determined by requiring correct Boltzmann sampling for linear systems, regardless of time step. The result is a set of statistically correct methods given by one free functional parameter, which can be interpreted as the one-time-step velocity attenuation factor. We define the statistical characteristics of both true on-site vn and true half-step un+1/2 velocities, and use these definitions for each statistically correct St√∏rmer-Verlet method to find a unique associated half-step velocity expression, which yields correct kinetic Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for linear systems. It is shown that no other similar, statistically correct on-site velocity exists. We further discuss the use and features of finite-difference velocity definitions that are neither true on-site, nor true half-step. The set of methods is written in convenient and conventional stochastic Verlet forms that lend themselves to direct implementation for, e.g. Molecular Dynamics applications. We highlight a few specific examples, and validate the algorithms through comprehensive Langevin simulations of both simple nonlinear oscillators and complex Molecular Dynamics.},

  abstract = {Tilt of hydrocarbon chains of lipid molecules with respect to membrane plane is commonly considered to characterize the internal structure of a membrane in the crystalline state. However, membranes in the liquid state can also exhibit tilt resulting from packing constraints imposed on the lipid molecules in diverse biologically relevant structures such as intermediates of membrane fusion, pores in lipid bilayers and others. We analyze the energetics of tilt in liquid membranes and its coupling with membrane bending. We consider three contributions to the elastic energy: constant tilt, variation of tilt along the membrane surface and membrane bending. The major assumption of the model is that the core of a liquid membrane has the common properties of an elastic continuum. We show that the variation of tilt and membrane bending are additive and that their energy contributions are determined by the same elastic coefficient: the Helfrich bending modulus, the modulus of Gaussian curvature and the spontaneous curvature known from previous studies of pure bending. The energy of a combined deformation of bending and varying tilt is determined by an effective tensor accounting for the two factors. In contrast, the deformation of constant tilt does not couple with bending and its contribution to the elastic energy is determined by an independent elastic constant. While accurate determination of this constant requires additional measurements, we estimate its value using a simplified approach. We discuss the relationships between the obtained elastic Hamiltonian of a membrane and the previous models of membrane elasticity.},

The previous studies of the inverted hexagonal, HII , and inverted micellar cubic, QII , phases considered the amphiphilic monolayers to be homogeneously bent. In contrast, we assume a unit cell of an inverted mesophase to consist of flat fragments of monolayer. Hence, the unit cells of the HII and QII phases are represented by a hexagonal rod and a polyhedron, respectively. Our model is motivated by Turner and Gruner‚Äôs X-ray diffraction reconstruction of structure of the HII phase. The only deformation of the amphiphilic monolayers we consider is tilt of the hydrocarbon chains with respect to the monolayer surface, determined by the packing constraints imposed in the mesophases. Applying our recent model for the elastic energy of tilt in liquid membranes [23], we show that: i) tilt accounts in a natural way for the frustration energy of mesophases resulting from filling by the hydrocarbon chains the corners of the unit cells, ii) the energy of tilt variation along the membrane surface is analogous to the bending energy. We compute the energetics of the HII , QIIsc and QIIfcc phases and obtain a hypothetical phase diagram in terms of the elastic constants of monolayers. Moreover, we calculate the structural dimensions of the mesophases. We verify the model showing that the obtained phase diagram describes the recent data for the glycolipids/water systems; the predicted dimensions of the QII phase are in accord with the measured values; the model treats quantitatively the structural features observed for the HII phase.},

In the next section of the review, we discuss how certain chromatin-associated proteins undergo LLPS in vitro and in vivo. Some chromatin-binding proteins undergo LLPS in purified form in near-physiological ionic strength buffers while others will do so only in the presence of DNA, nucleosomes, or chromatin. The final section of the review evaluates the solid and liquid states of chromatin in the nucleus. While chromatin behaves as an immobile solid on the mesoscale, nucleosomes are mobile on the nanoscale. We discuss how this dual nature of chromatin, which fits well the concept of viscoelasticity, contributes to genome structure, emphasizing the dominant role of chromatin self-interaction.},

  abstract = {Background: ESCRT-III is a membrane remodelling filament with the unique ability to cut membranes from the inside of the membrane neck. It is essential for the final stage of cell division, the formation of vesicles, the release of viruses, and membrane repair. Distinct from other cytoskeletal filaments, ESCRT-III filaments do not consume energy themselves, but work in conjunction with another ATP-consuming complex. Despite rapid progress in describing the cell biology of ESCRT-III, we lack an understanding of the physical mechanisms behind its force production and membrane remodelling. Results: Here we present a minimal coarse-grained model that captures all the experimentally reported cases of ESCRT-III driven membrane sculpting, including the formation of downward and upward cones and tubules. This model suggests that a change in the geometry of membrane bound ESCRT-III filaments‚Äîfrom a flat spiral to a 3D helix‚Äîdrives membrane deformation. We then show that such repetitive filament geometry transitions can induce the fission of cargo-containing vesicles. Conclusions: Our model provides a general physical mechanism that explains the full range of ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodelling and scission events observed in cells. This mechanism for filament force production is distinct from the mechanisms described for other cytoskeletal elements discovered so far. The mechanistic principles revealed here suggest new ways of manipulating ESCRT-III-driven processes in cells and could be used to guide the engineering of synthetic membrane-sculpting systems.},

  abstract = {Living systems propagate by undergoing rounds of cell growth and division. Cell division is at heart a physical process that requires mechanical forces, usually exerted by assemblies of cytoskeletal polymers. Here we developed a physical model for the ESCRT-III‚Äìmediated division of archaeal cells, which despite their structural simplicity share machinery and evolutionary origins with eukaryotes. By comparing the dynamics of simulations with data collected from live cell imaging experiments, we propose that this branch of life uses a previously unidentified division mechanism. Active changes in the curvature of elastic cytoskeletal filaments can lead to filament perversions and supercoiling, to drive ring constriction and deform the overlying membrane. Abscission is then completed following filament disassembly. The model was also used to explore how different adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-driven processes that govern the way the structure of the filament is changed likely impact the robustness and symmetry of the resulting division. Comparisons between midcell constriction dynamics in simulations and experiments reveal a good agreement with the process when changes in curvature are implemented at random positions along the filament, supporting this as a possible mechanism of ESCRT-III‚Äìdependent division in this system. Beyond archaea, this study pinpoints a general mechanism of cytokinesis based on dynamic coupling between a coiling filament and the membrane. Significance: Cell division is an essential requirement for life. Division requires mechanical forces, often exerted by protein assemblies from the cell interior, that split a single cell into two. Using coarse-grained computer simulations and live cell imaging we define a distinct cell division mechanism‚Äîbased on the forces generated by the supercoiling of an elastic filament as it disassembles. Our analysis suggests that such a mechanism could explain ESCRT-III‚Äìdependent division in Sulfolobus cells, based on the similarity of the dynamics of division obtained in simulations to those observed using live cell imaging. In this way our study furthers our understanding of the physical mechanisms used to reshape cells across evolution and identifies additional design principles for a minimal division machinery.},

  abstract = {A sufficiently large force acting on a single point of the fluid membrane of a flaccid phospholipid vesicle is known to cause the formation of a narrow bilayer tube (tether). We analyze this phenomenon by means of general mathematical methods allowing us to determine the shapes of strongly deformed vesicles including their stability. Starting from a free vesicle with an axisymmetric, prolate equilibrium shape, we consider an axial load that pulls (or pushes) the poles of the vesicle apart. Arranging the resulting shapes of strained vesicles in dependence of the axial deformation and of the area difference of monolayers, phase diagrams of stable shapes are presented comprising prolate shapes with or without equatorial mirror symmetry. For realistic values of membrane parameters, we study the force‚Äì extension relation of strained vesicles, and we demonstrate in detail how the initially elongated shape of an axially stretched vesicle transforms into a shape involving a membrane tether. This tethering transition may be continuous or discontinuous. If the free vesicle is mirror symmetric, the mirror symmetry is broken as the tether forms. The stability analysis of tethered shapes reveals that, for the considered vesicles, the stable shape is always asymmetric (polar), i.e., it involves only a single tether on one side of the main vesicle body. Although a bilayer tube formed from a closed vesicle is not an ideal cylinder, we show that, for most practical purposes, it is safe to assume a cylindrical geometry of tethers. This analysis is supplemented by the documentation of a prototype experiment supporting our theoretical predictions. It shows that the currently accepted model for the description of lipid-bilayer elasticity (generalized bilayer couple model) properly accounts for the tethering phenomenon.},

We follow the time course of this process in initially round passive neutrophils presented with antibody-coated beads of radii 1.1 to 5.5 ¬µm. In particular, we monitor the cortical tension as the apparent cellular surface area increases due to cell-driven deformations induced by phagocytosis. The behavior of the tension is then compared with conditions of similar area expansion caused by externally imposed deformations during cell aspiration into a micropipette. Whereas the resting tension remains low for an area expansion of up to only 30\% during aspiration, it remains low even after an area expansion of up to 80\% in phagocytosis. This is probably the result of membrane insertion from inner stores by exocytosis. We further find that the onset of viscous tension, proportional to the rate of area expansion and caused by the unfurling of plasma membrane wrinkles, is significantly delayed in phagocytosis compared with aspiration. We propose that this is the result of phagocytosis-triggered enzymatic activity that releases spare plasma membrane normally sequestered by velcrolike bonds in a reservoir of surface folds and villi.},

  abstract = {Lipid bilayers can exhibit asymmetric states, in which the physical characteristics of one leaflet differ from those of the other. This most visibly manifests in a different lipid composition, but it can also involve opposing lateral stresses in each leaflet that combine to an overall vanishing membrane tension. Here, we use theoretical modeling and coarse-grained simulation to explore the interplay between a compositional asymmetry and a nonvanishing differential stress. Minimizing the total elastic energy leads to a preferred spontaneous curvature that balances torques due to both bending moments and differential stress, with sometimes unexpected consequences. For instance, asymmetric flat bilayers, whose specific areas in each leaflet are matched to those of corresponding tensionless symmetric flat membranes, still exhibit a residual differential stress because the conditions of vanishing area strain and vanishing bending moment differ. We also measure the curvature rigidity of asymmetric bilayers and find that a sufficiently strong differential stress, but not compositional asymmetry alone, can increase the bending modulus. The likely cause is a stiffening of the compressed leaflet, which appears to be related to its gel transition but not identical with it. We finally show that the impact of cholesterol on differential stress depends on the relative strength of elastic and thermodynamic driving forces: if cholesterol solvates equally well in both leaflets, it will redistribute to cancel both leaflet tensions almost completely, but if its partitioning free energy prefers one leaflet over the other, the resulting distribution bias may even create differential stress. Because cells keep most of their lipid bilayers in an asymmetric nonequilibrium steady state, our findings suggest that biomembranes are elastically more complex than previously thought: besides a spontaneous curvature, they might also exhibit significant differential stress, which could strongly affect their curvature energetics.},

  abstract = {Significance             Small unilamellar vesicles formed via self-assembly of phospholipids or block copolymers have been investigated in the context of human physiology and biomedical research. Here, we present both energetics and thermodynamics analyses that incorporate nonlinear elasticity to predict, in a unique manner, the limiting size and size distribution of vesicles as well as to identify the conditions for the formation of stable open vesicles, disks, and closed spherical vesicles. In addition to providing a comprehensive understanding of vesicle formation, the framework presented here may be adapted to develop tools for in vivo liquid biopsies and to elucidate the biophysical features of extracellular vesicles, thus suggesting new approaches to diagnostics and therapeutics for cancer and other diseases.           ,              When detergents and phospholipid membranes are dispersed in aqueous solutions, they tend to self-assemble into vesicles of various shapes and sizes by virtue of their hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. A clearer understanding of such vesiculation processes holds promise for better elucidation of human physiology and disease, and paves the way to improved diagnostics, drug development, and drug delivery. Here we present a detailed analysis of the energetics and thermodynamics of vesiculation by recourse to nonlinear elasticity, taking into account large deformation that may arise during the vesiculation process. The effects of membrane size, spontaneous curvature, and membrane stiffness on vesiculation and vesicle size distribution were investigated, and the critical size for vesicle formation was determined and found to compare favorably with available experimental evidence. Our analysis also showed that the critical membrane size for spontaneous vesiculation was correlated with membrane thickness, and further illustrated how the combined effects of membrane thickness and physical properties influenced the size, shape, and distribution of vesicles. These findings shed light on the formation of physiological extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes. The findings also suggest pathways for manipulating the size, shape, distribution, and physical properties of synthetic vesicles, with potential applications in vesicle physiology, the pathobiology of cancer and other diseases, diagnostics using in vivo liquid biopsy, and drug delivery methods.},

The study builds on and extends the major contribution to spherical shell buckling by Koiter in the 1960s. Numerical results are presented for the axisymmetric large deflection behaviour of perfect spheres followed by an extensive analysis of the role axisymmetric imperfections play in reducing the buckling pressure. Several types of middle surface imperfections are considered including dimple-shaped undulations and sinusoidal-shaped equatorial undulations. Buckling occurs either as the attainment of a maximum pressure in the axisymmetric state or as a non-axisymmetric bifurcation from the axisymmetric state. Several new findings emerge: the abrupt mode localization that occurs immediately after the onset of buckling, the existence of an apparent lower limit to the buckling pressure for realistically large imperfections, and comparable reductions of the buckling pressure for dimple and sinusoidal equatorial imperfections.},

Molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the detailed architectural properties of the DNA rings observed in electron microscopy. Theory and simulations predict DNA ring contraction ‚Äì without motor proteins ‚Äì providing mechanistic insights into the parameter space relevant for efficient nanotube sliding. In agreement between simulation and experiment, we obtain ring contraction to less than half of the initial ring diameter.

It is robust, efficient and prevents the inversion of triangles. The second triangulation is dynamically created from the first one at each frame and provides details in regions of high curvature. Lastly, we present a mechanism to deal with both the topological merging and splitting of surfaces.

  abstract = {Over the last few years, coarse-grained molecular dynamics has emerged as a way to model large and complex systems in an efficient and inexpensive manner due to its lowered resolution, faster dynamics, and larger time steps. However, developing coarse-grained models and subsequently, the accurate interaction potentials (force-field parameters) is a challenging task. Traditional parameterisation techniques, although tedious, have been used extensively to develop CG models for a variety of solvent, soft-matter and biological systems. With the advent of sophisticated optimisation methods, machine learning, and hybrid approaches for force-field parameterisation, models with a higher degree of transferability and accuracy can be developed in a shorter period of time. We review here, some of these traditional and advanced parameterisation techniques while also shedding light on several transferable CG models developed in our group over the years using such an advanced method developed by us. These models, including solvents, polymers and biomolecules have helped us study important solute-solvent interactions and complex polymer architectures, thus paving a way to make experimentally verifiable observations.},

  abstract = {Plasma membrane damage and rupture occurs frequently in cells, and holes must be sealed rapidly to ensure homeostasis and cell survival. The membrane repair machinery is known to involve recruitment of curvature-inducing annexin proteins, but the connection between membrane remodeling and hole closure is poorly described. The induction of curvature by repair proteins leads to the possible formation of a membrane neck around the hole as a key intermediate structure before sealing. We formulate a theoretical model of equilibrium neck shapes to examine the potential connection to a repair mechanism. Using variational calculus, the shape equations for the membrane near a hole are formulated and solved numerically. The system is described under a condition of fixed area, and a shooting approach is applied to fulfill the boundary conditions at the free membrane edge. A state diagram of neck shapes is produced describing the variation in neck morphology with respect to the membrane area. Two distinct types of necks are predicted, one with conformations curved beyond p existing at positive excess area, whereas flat neck conformations (curved below p) have negative excess area. The results indicate that in cells, the supply of additional membrane area and a change in edge tension is linked to the formation of narrow and curved necks. Such necks may be susceptible to passive or actively induced membrane fission as a possible mechanism for hole sealing during membrane repair in cells.},

However, the design of proteins for emergent functions of core relevance to cells, such as the ability to spatiotemporally self-organize and thereby structure the cellular space, is still extremely challenging. While on the generative side conditional generative models and multi-state design are on the rise, for emergent functions there is a lack of tailored screening methods as typically needed in a protein design project, both computational and experimental. Here we describe a proof-of-principle of how such screening, in silico and in vitro, can be achieved for ML-generated variants of a protein that forms intracellular spatiotemporal patterns. For computational screening we use a structure-based divide-and-conquer approach to find the most promising candidates, while for the subsequent in vitro screening we use synthetic cell-mimics as established by Bottom-Up Synthetic Biology. We then show that the best screened candidate can indeed completely substitute the wildtype gene in               Escherichia coli               . These results raise great hopes for the next level of synthetic biology, where ML-designed synthetic proteins will be used to engineer cellular functions.},

Besides demonstrating these essential features, we highlight the importance of decisive experimental factors, such as macromolecular crowding.

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, the spatial organization of biomembranes has received a lot of attention. With the fluid mosaic model, Singer and Nicolson proposed that biomembranes behave as two-dimensional fluids, allowing proteins and lipids to diffuse freely and thus react to external stimuli. Biological functionality and membrane organization are intricately linked to each other, however, how these organizations emerge is yet to be established. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to explore the relationship between membrane shape and lateral organization at the nanoscale for a broad range of lipid mixtures. Our results illustrate that membrane curvature and lateral organization are intimately linked at the nanoscale and the relationship is much more complicated compared to the traditional views, in particular the lipid shape concept. Furthermore, we show that large membrane curvature can disrupt phase separation, line tension, and interleaflet coupling leading to non-intuitive lipid sorting. Our findings highlight how curvature-driven sorting can alter the phase behavior of lipid mixtures, which could be crucial for cellular functionality.},

Methods based on RNA velocity, often in combination with non-linear dimensionality reduction, have been proposed. However, interpreting their results in the light of the underlying biology remains difficult, and their predictive power is limited. Here we propose NeuroVelo, a method that couples learning of an optimal linear projection with a non-linear low-dimensional dynamical system. Using dynamical systems theory, NeuroVelo can then identify genes and biological processes driving temporal cellular dynamics. We benchmark NeuroVelo against several current methods using single-cell multi-omic data, demonstrating that NeuroVelo is superior to competing methods in terms of identifying biological pathways and reconstructing evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract = {Specialized classes of proteins, working together in a tightly orchestrated manner, induce and maintain highly curved cellular and organelles membrane morphology. Due to the various experimental constraints, including the resolution limits of imaging techniques, it is non-trivial to accurately elucidate interactions among the various components involved in membrane deformation. The spatial and temporal scales of the systems also make it formidable to investigate them using simulations with molecular details. Interestingly, mechanics-based mesoscopic models have been used with great success in recapitulating the membrane deformations observed in experiments. In this review, we collate together and discuss the various mechanics-based mesoscopic models for protein-mediated membrane deformation studies. In particular, we provide an elaborate description of a mesoscopic model where the membrane is modeled as a triangulated sheet and proteins are represented as either nematics or filaments. This representation allows us to explore the various aspects of protein‚Äìprotein and protein‚Äìmembrane interactions as well as examine the underlying mechanistic pathways for emergent behavior such as curvature-mediated protein localization and membrane deformation. We also put forward current efforts in the field towards back-mapping these mesoscopic models to finer-grained particle-based models‚Äîa framework that could be used to explore how molecular interactions propagate to physical scales and vice-versa. We end the review with an integrative-modelingbased road map where experimental imaging micrograph and biochemical data are combined with mesoscopic and molecular simulations methods in a theoretically consistent manner to faithfully recapitulate the multiple length and time scales in the membrane remodeling processes.},

Despite being one of the first intracellular structures visualized historically, the biophysical rules governing its assembly and function are only starting to become clear. Recent studies have provided increasing support for the concept that the nucleolus represents a multilayered biomolecular condensate, whose formation by liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation (LLPS) facilitates the initial steps of ribosome biogenesis and other functions. Here, we review these biophysical insights in the context of the molecular and cell biology of the nucleolus. We discuss how nucleolar function is linked to its organization as a multiphase condensate and how dysregulation of this organization could provide insights into still poorly understood aspects of nucleolus-associated diseases, including cancer, ribosomopathies and neurodegeneration as well as ageing. We suggest that the LLPS model provides the starting point for a unifying quantitative framework for the assembly, structural maintenance and function of the nucleolus, with implications for gene regulation and ribonucleoprotein particle assembly throughout the nucleus. The LLPS concept is also likely useful in designing new therapeutic strategies to target nucleolar dysfunction.},

In addition to that, some molecules can sense membrane curvature and thereby be trafficked to specific locations. The description of curvature sensing is another fundamental challenge. Curved lipid membranes and their interplay with membrane-associated proteins can be investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Various methods for simulating curved membranes with MD are discussed here, including tools for setting up simulation of vesicles and methods for sustaining membrane curvature. The latter are divided into methods that exploit scaffolding virtual beads, methods that use curvature-inducing molecules, and methods applying virtual forces. The variety of simulation tools allow researcher to closely match the conditions of experimental studies of membrane curvatures.},

This pattern formation is robust enough to warrant its use in taxonomic classification. Focusing on pollen, we propose a theory of transitions to spatially modulated phases on spheres to explain both the variability and robustness of the patterns. We find that the sphere geometry allows for a wider variety of patterns compared with planar surfaces. A species may robustly ‚Äúchoose‚Äù among the possibilities by locally nucleating a patch of the pattern. We expect our theory to describe a wide variety of pattern-forming processes on spherical geometries.           ,              We propose a general theory for surface patterning in many different biological systems, including mite and insect cuticles, pollen grains, fungal spores, and insect eggs. The patterns of interest are often intricate and diverse, yet an individual pattern is robustly reproducible by a single species and a similar set of developmental stages produces a variety of patterns. We argue that the pattern diversity and reproducibility may be explained by interpreting the pattern development as a first-order phase transition to a spatially modulated phase. Brazovskii showed that for such transitions on a flat, infinite sheet, the patterns are uniform striped or hexagonal. Biological objects, however, have finite extent and offer different topologies, such as the spherical surfaces of pollen grains. We consider Brazovskii transitions on spheres and show that the patterns have a richer phenomenology than simple stripes or hexagons. We calculate the free energy difference between the unpatterned state and the many possible patterned phases, taking into account fluctuations and the system‚Äôs finite size. The proliferation of variety on a sphere may be understood as a consequence of topology, which forces defects into perfectly ordered phases. The defects are then accommodated in different ways. We also argue that the first-order character of the transition is responsible for the reproducibility and robustness of the pattern formation.},

This remodeling is essential for important biological processes (cell division, intracellular vesicle trafficking, endocytosis) and can be elucidated in a systematic and quantitative manner using synthetic membrane systems. Here, recent insights obtained from such synthetic systems are reviewed, integrating experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations with the theory of membrane elasticity. The study starts from the polymorphism of biomembranes as observed for giant vesicles by optical microscopy and small nanovesicles in simulations. This polymorphism reflects the unusual elasticity of fluid membranes and includes the formation of membrane necks or fluid ‚Äòworm holes'. The proliferation of membrane necks generates stable multi‚Äêspherical shapes, which can form tubules and tubular junctions. Membrane necks are also essential for the remodeling of membrane topology via membrane fission and fusion. Neck fission can be induced by fine‚Äêtuning of membrane curvature, which leads to the controlled division of giant vesicles, and by adhesion‚Äêinduced membrane tension as observed for small nanovesicles. Challenges for future research include the interplay of curvature elasticity and membrane tension during membrane fusion and the localization of fission and fusion processes within intramembrane domains.},

To illustrate the role of bending energy in these processes, we study the response of single-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) subjected to external osmotic stress by glucose addition. For osmotic pressures exceeding 0.15 atm, an abrupt shape change from spherical to prolate occurs, showing that the osmotic pressure is balanced by the free energy of membrane bending. After equilibration, the external glucose solution was exchanged for pure water, yielding rapid formation of monodisperse daughter vesicles inside the GUVs through an endocytosis-like process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this process requires significant free energies stored in the deformed membrane to be kinetically allowed. The results indicate that bending energies stored in GUVs are much higher than previously implicated, with potential consequences for vesicle fusion/fission and the osmotic regulation in living cells.},

In this work, we show the electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of a bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP) helical filament decorating a lipid tube at  11 AÀö resolution. We fitted the BDLP crystal structure and produced a molecular model for the entire filament. The BDLP GTPase domain dimerizes and forms the tube surface, the GTPase effector domain (GED) mediates selfassembly, and the paddle region contacts the lipids and promotes curvature. Association of BDLP with GMPPNP and lipid induces radical, large-scale conformational changes affecting polymerization. Nucleotide hydrolysis seems therefore to be coupled to polymer disassembly and dissociation from lipid, rather than membrane restructuring. Observed structural similarities with rat dynamin 1 suggest that our results have broad implication for other dynamin family members.},

Martini is a widely used coarse-grained force field with applications in biomolecular simulation, materials, and broader areas of chemistry. It is implemented as a force field but makes extensive use of facilities unique to the GROMACS software, including virtual sites and bonded terms that are not commonly used in standard atomistic force fields. OpenMM is a flexible molecular dynamics package widely used for methods development and is competitive in speed on GPUs with other commonly used packages. OpenMM has facilities to easily implement new force field terms, external forces and fields, and other nonstandard features, which we use to implement all force field terms used in Martini 2 and Martini 3. This allows Martini simulations, starting with GROMACS topology files that are processed by custom scripts, with all the added flexibility of OpenMM. We provide a GitHub repository with test cases, compare accuracy and performance between GROMACS and OpenMM, and discuss the limitations of our implementation in terms of direct comparison with GROMACS. We describe a use case that implements the Modeling Employing Limited Data method to apply experimental constraints in a Martini simulation to efficiently determine the structure of a protein complex. We also discuss issues and a potential solution with the Martini 2 topology for cholesterol.},

We show that a physical model of a chromosome with experimentally measured local interactions segregates into euchromatin- and heterochromatin-like phases. The model reproduces many of the features of the large-scale organization of the chromosome as measured by Hi-C. Our work provides an estimate of the amount of epigenetic marking needed to segregate a gene into heterochromatin.           ,              We use a chromosome-scale simulation to show that the preferential binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to regions high in histone methylation (specifically H3K9me3) results in phase segregation and reproduces features of the observed Hi-C contact map. Specifically, we perform Monte Carlo simulations with one computational bead per nucleosome and an H3K9me3 pattern based on published ChIP-seq signals. We implement a binding model in which HP1 preferentially binds to trimethylated histone tails and then oligomerizes to bridge together nucleosomes. We observe a phase reminiscent of heterochromatin‚Äîdense and high in H3K9me3‚Äîand another reminiscent of euchromatin‚Äîless dense and lacking H3K9me3. This segregation results in a plaid contact probability map that matches the general shape and position of published Hi-C data. Analysis suggests that a roughly 20-kb segment of H3K9me3 enrichment is required to drive segregation into the heterochromatic phase.},

  abstract = {A layer of dense heterochromatin is found at the periphery of the nucleus. Because this peripheral heterochromatin functions as a repressive phase, mechanisms that relocate genes to the periphery play an important role in regulating transcription. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an interaction that attracts euchromatin and heterochromatin equally to the nuclear envelope will still preferentially locate heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery. This observation considerably broadens the class of possible interactions that result in peripheral positioning to include boundary interactions that either weakly attract all chromatin or strongly bind to a randomly chosen 0.05\% of nucleosomes. The key distinguishing feature of heterochromatin is its high chromatin density with respect to euchromatin. In our model, this densification is caused by heterochromatin protein 1‚Äôs preferential binding to histone H3 tails with a methylated lysine at the ninth residue, a hallmark of heterochromatin. We find that a global rearrangement of chromatin to place heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery can be accomplished by attaching a small subset of loci, even if these loci are uncorrelated with heterochromatin. Hence, factors that densify chromatin determine which genomic regions condense to form peripheral heterochromatin.},

  abstract = {The Martini model, a coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations, has been around for nearly two decades. Originally developed for lipidbased systems by the groups of Marrink and Tieleman, the Martini model has over the years been extended as a community effort to the current level of a general-purpose force field. Apart from the obvious benefit of a reduction in computational cost, the popularity of the model is largely due to the systematic yet intuitive building-block approach that underlies the model, as well as the open nature of the development and its continuous validation. The easy implementation in the widely used Gromacs software suite has also been instrumental. Since its conception in 2002, the Martini model underwent a gradual refinement of the bead interactions and a widening scope of applications. In this review, we look back at this development, culminating with the release of the Martini 3 version in 2021. The power of the model is illustrated with key examples of recent important findings in biological and material sciences enabled with Martini, as well as examples from areas where coarse-grained resolution is essential, namely highthroughput applications, systems with large complexity, and simulations approaching the scale of whole cells.},

The illusive simplicity of membrane reshaping masks a complex molecular process crucial for a wide range of biological functions like fusion, endo- and exocytosis, cell division, cytokinesis, and autophagy. To date, no functional expression of a reaction coordinate capable of biasing molecular dynamics simulations to produce membrane curvature has been reported. This represents a major drawback given that the adequate identification of proper collective variables to enhance sampling is fundamental for restrained dynamics techniques. In this work, we present a closed-form equation of a collective variable that induces bending in lipid bilayers in a controlled manner, allowing for straightforward calculation of free energy landscapes of important curvature-related events, using standard methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics. As a direct application of the collective variable, we calculate the bending free energies of a ternary lipid bilayer in the presence and the absence of a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix (N-BAR), a well-known peripheral membrane protein that induces curvature.},

  abstract = {The transport of particles across lipid-bilayer membranes is important for biological cells to exchange information and material with their environment. Large particles often get wrapped by membranes, a process which has been intensively investigated in the case of hard particles. However, many particles in vivo and in vitro are deformable, e.g., vesicles, filamentous viruses, macromolecular condensates, polymer-grafted nanoparticles, and microgels. Vesicles may serve as a generic model system for deformable particles. Here, we study nonspherical vesicles with various sizes, shapes, and elastic properties at initially planar lipid-bilayer membranes. Using the Helfrich Hamiltonian, triangulated membranes, and energy minimization, we predict the interplay of vesicle shapes and wrapping states. Increasing particle softness enhances the stability of shallow-wrapped and deep-wrapped states over nonwrapped and complete-wrapped states. The free membrane mediates an interaction between partial-wrapped vesicles. For the pair interaction between deep-wrapped vesicles, we predict repulsion. For shallow-wrapped vesicles, we predict attraction for tip-to-tip orientation and repulsion for side-by-side orientation. Our predictions may guide the design and fabrication of deformable particles for efficient use in medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery.},

The novel technique performs very well on both model and biophysical problems in accord with a formal theoretical analysis given within, which gives an explicit condition for an integrator to possess a conserved quantity, an explicit expression for the conserved quantity of a symplectic integrator, the latter following and in accord with Calvo and Sanz-Sarna, Numerical Hamiltonian Problems (1994), and extension of the explicit expression to general systems with a flat phase space.},

  abstract = {The fractal globule is a compact polymer state that emerges during polymer condensation as a result of topological constraints which prevent one region of the chain from passing across another one. This long-lived intermediate state was introduced in 1988 (Grosberg et al. 1988) and has not been observed in experiments or simulations until recently (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Recent characterization of human chromatin using a novel chromosome conformational capture technique brought the fractal globule into the spotlight as a structural model of human chromosome on the scale of up to 10~Mb (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Here, we present the concept of the fractal globule, comparing it to other states of a polymer and focusing on its properties relevant for the biophysics of chromatin. We then discuss properties of the fractal globule that make it an attractive model for chromatin organization inside a cell. Next, we connect the fractal globule to recent studies that emphasize topological constraints as a primary factor driving formation of chromosomal territories. We discuss how theoretical predictions, made on the basis of the fractal globule model, can be tested experimentally. Finally, we discuss whether fractal globule architecture can be relevant for chromatin packing in other organisms such as yeast and bacteria.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular crowding affects the activity of proteins and functional macromolecular complexes in all cells, including bacteria. Crowding, together with physicochemical parameters such as pH, ionic strength, and the energy status, influences the structure of the cytoplasm and thereby indirectly macromolecular function. Notably, crowding also promotes the formation of biomolecular condensates by phase separation, initially identified in eukaryotic cells but more recently discovered to play key functions in bacteria. Bacterial cells require a variety of mechanisms to maintain physicochemical homeostasis, in particular in environments with fluctuating conditions, and the formation of biomolecular condensates is emerging as one such mechanism. In this work, we connect physicochemical homeostasis and macromolecular crowding with the formation and function of biomolecular condensates in the bacterial cell and compare the supramolecular structures found in bacteria with those of eukaryotic cells. We focus on the effects of crowding and phase separation on the control of bacterial chromosome replication, segregation, and cell division, and we discuss the contribution of biomolecular condensates to bacterial cell fitness and adaptation to environmental stress.},

Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium               Escherichia coli               . We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative (               Caulobacter crescentus               ) or Gram-positive (               Staphylococcus aureus               ) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (Œî               envC               Œî               nlpD               ) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.},

  abstract = {Peripheral membrane proteins with intrinsic curvature can act both as sensors of membrane curvature and shape modulators of the underlying membranes. A well-studied example of such proteins is the mechanochemical GTPase dynamin, which assembles into helical filaments around membrane tubes and catalyzes their scission in a GTPase-dependent manner. It is known that the dynamin coat alone, without GTP, can constrict membrane tubes to radii of \$10 nm, indicating that the intrinsic shape and elasticity of dynamin filaments should play an important role in membrane remodeling. However, molecular and dynamic understanding of the process is lacking. Here, we develop a dynamical polymer-chain model for a helical elastic filament bound on a deformable membrane tube of conserved mass, accounting for thermal fluctuations in the filament and lipid flows in the membrane. The model is based on the locally cylindrical helix approximation for dynamin. We obtain the elastic parameters of the dynamin filament by molecular dynamics simulations of its tetrameric building block and also from coarse-grained structure-based simulations of a 17-dimer filament. The results show that the stiffness of dynamin is comparable to that of the membrane. We determine equilibrium shapes of the filament and the membrane and find that mostly the pitch of the filament, not its radius, is sensitive to variations in membrane tension and stiffness. The close correspondence between experimental estimates of the inner tube radius and those predicted by the model suggests that dynamin‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äòstalk‚Äô‚Äô region is responsible for its GTP-independent membrane-shaping ability. The model paves the way for future mesoscopic modeling of dynamin with explicit motor function.},

In this study, we clarify how the binding of proteins with a laterally isotropic spontaneous curvature senses and generates the membrane curvatures of the tethered vesicle using mean-field theory and meshless membrane simulation. The force-dependence curves of the protein density in the membrane tube and the tube curvature are reflection symmetric and point symmetric, respectively, from the force point, in which the tube has a sensing curvature. The bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature of the bound proteins can be estimated from these force-dependence curves. First-order transitions can occur between low and high protein densities in the tube at both low and high force amplitudes. The simulation results of the homogeneous phases agree very well with the theoretical predictions. In addition, beaded-necklace-like tubes with microphase separation are found in the simulation.},

On a mm scale, the molecular details are typically negligible and the membrane can be described as a continuous curved surface.

As structural information accumulates, theoretical methods become central to understand how different conformers interconvert to mediate biological function. Here we briefly survey current in silico methods to tackle large conformational changes, reviewing recent examples of cross-validation of experiments and computational predictions, which show how the integration of different scale simulations with biological information is already starting to break the barriers between the in silico, in vitro, and in vivo worlds, shedding new light onto complex biological problems inaccessible so far.},

We find that universal scaling exponents of the bulk system also apply in the confined case; however, certain important differences arise. First, due to confinement effects, the static and threading properties of the rings depend on their radial position within the confining sphere. Second, the rings‚Äô dynamics is overall subdiffusive, but anisotropic along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the sphere‚Äôs radius. The radial center of mass displacements of the rings are in general much smaller than the angular ones, which is caused by the confinement-induced inhomogeneous radial distribution of the whole rings within the sphere. Finally, we find enhanced contact times between rings as compared to the bulk, which indicates slow and predominantly coordinated pathways of the relaxation of the system.},

In vitro, FtsZ polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner forming a variety of filamentous flexible structures. Based on data derived from the measurement of the in vitro polymerization of Escherichia coli FtsZ cell division protein we have formulated a model in which the fine balance between curvature, flexibility and lateral interactions accounts for structural and dynamic properties of the FtsZ polymers observed with AFM. The experimental results have been used by the model to calibrate the interaction energies and the values obtained indicate that the filaments are very plastic. The extension of the model to explore filament behavior on a cylindrical surface has shown that the FtsZ condensates promoted by lateral interactions can easily form ring structures through minor modulations of either filament curvature or longitudinal bond energies. The condensation of short, monomer exchanging filaments into rings is shown to produce enough force to induce membrane deformations.},

This directional motion is generally controlled via active mechanical and chemical processes. Here we show, by means of molecular dynamics simulations and an analytical theory, that completely passive nanoparticles can exhibit directional motion when embedded in nonuniform mechanical environments. Specifically, we study the motion of a passive nanoparticle adhering to a mechanically nonuniform elastic membrane. We observe a nonmonotonic affinity of the particle to the membrane as a function of the membrane‚Äôs rigidity, which results in the particle transport. This transport can be both up or down the rigidity gradient, depending on the absolute values of the rigidities that the gradient spans across. We conclude that rigidity gradients can be used to direct average motion of passive macromolecules and nanoparticles on deformable membranes, resulting in the preferential accumulation of the macromolecules in regions of certain mechanical properties.},

Beyond changes of radius and pitch, we emphasize the crucial role of a third functional motion: an effective rotation of the filament around its longitudinal axis, which reflects alternate tilting of dynamin‚Äôs PH binding domains and creates a membrane torque. We also show that helix elongation impedes fission, hemifission is reached via a small transient pore, and coat disassembly assists fission. Our results have several testable structural consequences and help to reconcile mutual conflicting aspects between the two main present models of dynamin fission‚Äîthe two-stage and the constrictase model.},

By comparing the two architectures of linear               vs.               unconcatenated and unknotted circular polymers, we demonstrate that novel, rich physics emerge.

For larger nanoprobes, a surprising phenomenon occurs: while in linear solutions they move qualitatively as before, in active‚Äìpassive ring solutions nanoprobes decelerate with respect to the purely passive conditions. We rationalize this effect in terms of the non-equilibrium, topology-dependent association (clustering) of nanoprobes to the cold component of the ring mixture reminiscent of the recently discovered [Weber               et al.               ,               Phys.

The rapid development of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has revolutionized our capacity to probe such diversity. However, despite these advances, a theoretical understanding connecting empirical data with ecosystem modelling, in particular in the framework of disordered systems akin to spin glasses, is still in its infancy. Here, we present a comprehensive framework using theories of disordered systems to decode microbiome data, which offers insight into the ecological forces that shape macroecological states. By employing the quenched disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we analyze species abundance data in healthy and diseased human gut microbiomes. Results reveal the emergence of two distinct patterns of species-interaction networks, elucidating the pathways through which dysbiosis may drive microbiome instability. Interaction patterns thus provide a window into the systemic shifts accompanying the transition from health to disease, offering a new perspective on the dynamics of the microbial community. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered systems theory to characterize microbiomes by capturing the essence of ecological interactions and their consequences on stability and functioning, leveraging our understanding of the linkages of dysbiosis and microbial dynamics.},

First identified 50 years ago in a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, it has become a central player in many forms of endocytosis, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis or synaptic vesicle endocytosis, as well as other important cellular processes such as actin remodelling. Decades of work using biochemical and structural studies, cell-free assays, live cell imaging, acute inhibition and genetic studies have led to important insights on its mode of action. Dynamin is a remarkable mechano-GTPase, which can do a lot to membranes on its own but which is, in cells, at the centre of a vast protein and lipid network and cannot work in isolation. This review summarizes the main features of dynamin structure and function and its central role in membrane remodelling events, and give an update on the latest results.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many biological processes involve large-scale changes in membrane shape. Computer simulations of these processes are challenging since they occur across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales that cannot be investigated in full by any single current simulation technique. A potential solution is to combine different levels of resolution through a multiscale scheme. Here, we present a multiscale algorithm that backmaps a continuum membrane model represented as a dynamically triangulated surface (DTS) to its corresponding molecular model based on the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field. Thus, we can use DTS simulations to equilibrate slow large-scale membrane conformational changes and then explore the local properties at CG resolution. We demonstrate the power of our method by backmapping a vesicular bud induced by binding of Shiga toxin and by transforming the membranes of an entire mitochondrion to near-atomic resolution. Our approach opens the way to whole cell simulations at molecular detail.},

In this software, a membrane is represented by a dynamically triangulated surface equipped with vertex-based inclusions to integrate the effects of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Several algorithms are included in the software to simulate complex membranes at different conditions such as framed membranes with constant tension, vesicles and high-genus membranes with various fixed volumes or constant pressure differences and applying external forces to membrane regions. Furthermore, the software allows the user to turn off the shape evolution of the membrane and focus solely on the organization of proteins. As a result, we can take realistic membrane shapes obtained from, for example, cryo-electron tomography and backmap them into a finer simulation model. In addition to many biomembrane applications, this software brings us a step closer to simulating realistic biomembranes with molecular resolution. Here we provide several interesting showcases of the power of the software but leave a wide range of potential applications for interested users.},

The model is based on soft interactions between particles and short-range attractive interaction between lipid tails, leading for the self-assembly of a lipid bilayer without an explicit solvent. This allows for efficient simulations of large membranes over long times. The model exhibits a fluid phase at high temperatures and a gel phase at low temperatures, identified with the LŒ≤-phase. The melting transition is investigated via analysis of the diffusivity of the lipid molecules, the chain-orientational order parameter, the sixfold bond-orientational order parameter, and the positional and bond-orientational correlation functions. The analysis suggests the existence of a hexatic phase over a narrow range of temperatures around the melting transition. The elastic properties of the membrane in the fluid phase are also investigated.},

The early developments of simplified protein systems represented a stepping stone towards establishing more efficient approaches to sample intricated conformational landscapes. Downscaling the level of resolution of biomolecules to coarser representations allows for studying protein structure, dynamics and interactions that are not accessible by classical atomistic approaches. The combination of different resolutions, namely hybrid modeling, has also been proved as an alternative when mixed levels of details are required. In this review, we provide an overview of coarse-grained/hybrid models focusing on their applicability in the modeling of biomolecular interactions. We give a detailed list of ready-to-use modeling software for studying biomolecular interactions allowing various levels of coarse-graining and provide examples of complexes determined by integrative coarse-grained/hybrid approaches in combination with experimental information.},

  abstract = {Predicting the 3D structure of protein interactions remains a challenge in the field of computational structural biology. This is in part due to difficulties in sampling the complex energy landscape of multiple interacting flexible polypeptide chains. Coarse-graining approaches, which reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system, help address this limitation by smoothing the energy landscape, allowing an easier identification of the global energy minimum. They also accelerate the calculations, allowing for modeling larger assemblies. Here, we present the implementation of the MARTINI coarse-grained force field for proteins into HADDOCK, our integrative modeling platform. Docking and refinement are performed at the coarse-grained level, and the resulting models are then converted back to atomistic resolution through a distance restraints-guided morphing procedure. Our protocol, tested on the largest complexes of the protein docking benchmark 5, shows an overall ‚àº7-fold speed increase compared to standard all-atom calculations, while maintaining a similar accuracy and yielding substantially more near-native solutions. To showcase the potential of our method, we performed simultaneous 7 body docking to model the 1:6 KaiC-KaiB complex, integrating mutagenesis and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data from mass spectrometry with symmetry restraints, and validated the resulting models against a recently published cryo-EM structure.},

  abstract = {The great challenge with biological membrane systems is the wide range of scales involved, from nanometers and picoseconds for individual lipids to the micrometers and beyond millisecond for cellular signaling processes. While solvent-free coarse-grained membrane models are convenient for large-scale simulations and promising to provide insight into slow processes involving membranes, these models usually have unrealistic kinetics. One major obstacle is the lack of an equally convenient way of introducing hydrodynamic coupling without significantly increasing the computational cost of the model. To address this, we introduce a framework based on anisotropic Langevin dynamics, for which major in-plane and out-of-plane hydrodynamic effects are modeled via friction and diffusion tensors from analytical or semi-analytical solutions to Stokes hydrodynamic equations. Using this framework, in conjunction with our recently developed membrane model, we obtain accurate dispersion relations for planar membrane patches, both free-standing and in the vicinity of a wall. We briefly discuss how nonequilibrium dynamics is affected by hydrodynamic interactions. We also measure the surface viscosity of the model membrane and discuss the affecting dissipative mechanisms.},

Explicit molecular modelling of biologically relevant membrane systems is computationally expensive due to the large number of solvent particles and slow membrane kinetics. Coarse-grained solvent-free membrane models offer efficient sampling but sacrifice realistic kinetics, thereby limiting the ability to predict pathways and mechanisms of membrane processes. Here, we present a framework for integrating coarse-grained membrane models with continuum-based hydrodynamics. This framework facilitates efficient simulation of large biomembrane systems with large timesteps, while achieving realistic equilibrium and non-equilibrium kinetics. It helps to bridge between the nanometer/nanosecond spatiotemporal resolutions of coarse-grained models and biologically relevant time- and lengthscales. As a demonstration, we investigate fluctuations of red blood cells, with varying cytoplasmic viscosities, in 150-milliseconds-long trajectories, and compare kinetic properties against single-cell experimental observations.},

Significant membrane remodeling as in endo- and exocytosis is often due to aggregates of many proteins with direct or membranemediated interactions. Understanding this process via computer simulations is extremely challenging: protein‚àímembrane systems involve time and length scales that make atomistic simulations impractical, while most coarse-grained models fall short in resolving dynamics and physical effects of protein and membrane flexibility. Here, we develop a coarse-grained model of the bilayer membrane bestrewed with rotationally symmetric flexible proteins, parametrized to reflect local curvatures and lateral dynamics of proteins. We investigate the kinetics, equilibrium distributions, and the free energy landscape governing the formation and breakup of protein clusters on the surface of the membrane. We demonstrate how the flexibility of the proteins as well as their surface concentration play deciding roles in highly selective macroscopic aggregation behavior.},

  abstract = {This study presents a rigorous mechanical characterisation investigation on milk chocolate with varying porosities, at different temperatures and strain rate levels.           ,              This study presents a rigorous mechanical characterisation investigation on milk chocolate with varying porosities, at different temperatures and strain rate levels. Uniaxial compression tests at temperatures varying from 20 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C were performed to measure the bulk properties of chocolate as a function of porosity and temperature. Fracture experiments were also conducted to compute the fracture energy at temperature levels between 20 ¬∞C and 30 ¬∞C for all tested samples. Additionally, rheological experiments are conducted to compute the viscosity of the different chocolates at 37 ¬∞C. This combined experimental analysis of solid mechanics, fracture mechanics, and rheology aims to define the impact of temperature and chocolate's phase change from solid to liquid on its mechanical properties. Moreover, the impact of micro-aeration on the relationship between material properties and temperature is discussed. The results demonstrate a significant impact of both temperature and micro-aeration on the chocolate's material properties; fracture stresses decrease with micro-aeration due to the presence of micro-pores creating weak links in the chocolate matrix, the critical strain energy release rate decreases with micro-aeration at temperatures up to 25 ¬∞C and increases at temperatures above 30 ¬∞C. Finally, the viscosity at 37 ¬∞C increases with increasing porosity due to the obstruction of the flow by micro-pores acting as ‚Äúsolid‚Äù particles. The results highlight how the impact of micro-aeration on the material properties of chocolate alters as the testing temperature rises and the material changes phase. The relationships between the micro-aeration and material properties and the dependence of temperature on the different mechanical properties are used to explain the difference in textural attributes as obtained from temporal dominance sensation tests. This study seeks to contribute valuable insights into the field of chocolate technology, emphasizing the need for a combined engineering approach to understand the structural breakdown of chocolate during oral processing as mechanisms such as chewing, melting, mixing and shearing occur.},

  abstract = {A framework for performant Brownian Dynamics (BD) many-body simulations with adaptive timestepping is presented. Contrary to the Euler-Maruyama scheme in common non-adaptive BD, we employ an embedded Heun-Euler integrator for the propagation of the overdamped coupled Langevin equations of motion. This enables the derivation of a local error estimate and the formulation of criteria for the acceptance or rejection of trial steps and for the control of optimal stepsize. Introducing erroneous bias in the random forces is avoided by Rejection Sampling with Memory (RSwM) due to Rackauckas and Nie, which makes use of the Brownian bridge theorem and guarantees the correct generation of a specified random process even when rejecting trial steps. For test cases of Lennard-Jones fluids in bulk and in confinement, it is shown that adaptive BD solves performance and stability issues of conventional BD, already outperforming the latter even in standard situations. We expect this novel computational approach to BD to be especially helpful in long-time simulations of complex systems, e.g. in non-equilibrium, where concurrent slow and fast processes occur.},

Our lipid model is based on a well-tried CG polymer model with an additional potential that mimics the hydrophobic properties of lipid tails. We find that several stages of selforganization of lipid clusters are involved in the dynamics of bilayer formation and that the resulting equilibrium structures sensitively depend on the strength of hydrophobic interactions hc of the lipid tails and on temperature T. The obtained stable lipid membranes are quantitatively analyzed with respect to their local structure and their degree of order. At equilibrium, we obtain self-stabilizing bilayer membrane structures that exhibit a bending stiffness Œ∫B and compression modulus KC comparable to experimental measurements under physiological conditions. We present a phase diagram of our lipid model which covers a sol‚Äìgel transition, a liquid (or gellike) phase including stable bilayer structures and vesicle formation, as well as a quasi‚Äìcrystalline phase. We also determine the exact conditions for temperature T and degree of hydrophobicity hc for stable bilayer formation including closed vesicles.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a heightened interest in the selfassembly of nanoparticles (NPs) that is mediated by their adsorption onto lipid membranes. The interplay between the adhesive energy of NPs on a lipid membrane and the membrane‚Äôs curvature energy causes it to wrap around the NPs. This results in an interesting membrane curvature-mediated interaction, which can lead to the self-assembly of NPs on lipid membranes. Recent studies have demonstrated that Janus spherical NPs, which adhere to lipid vesicles, can self-assemble into wellordered nanoclusters with various geometries, including a few Platonic solids. The present study explores the additional effect of geometric anisotropy on the selfassembly of Janus NPs on lipid vesicles. Specifically, the current study utilized extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the arrangement of Janus spherocylindrical NPs on lipid vesicles. We found that the additional geometric anisotropy significantly expands the range of NPs‚Äô self-assemblies on lipid vesicles. The specific geometries of the resulting nanoclusters depend on several factors, including the number of Janus spherocylindrical NPs adhering to the vesicle and their aspect ratio. The lipid membrane-mediated self-assembly of NPs, demonstrated by this work, provides an alternative cost-effective route for fabricating highly engineered nanoclusters in three dimensions. Such structures, with the current wide range of material choices, have great potential for advanced applications, including biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, nanomechanics, and nanophotonics.},

  abstract = {Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the receptormediated endocytosis of elastic nanoparticles (NPs) with different sizes, ranging from 25 to 100 nm, and shapes, including sphere-like, oblate-like, and prolate-like. Simulation results provide clear evidence that the membrane wrapping efficiency of NPs during endocytosis is a result of competition between receptor diffusion kinetics and thermodynamic driving force. The receptor diffusion kinetics refer to the kinetics of receptor recruitment that are affected by the contact edge length between the NP and membrane. The thermodynamic driving force represents the amount of required free energy to drive NPs into a cell. Under the volume constraint of elastic NPs, the soft spherical NPs are found to have similar contact edge lengths to rigid ones and to less efficiently be fully wrapped due to their elastic deformation. Moreover, the difference in wrapping efficiency between soft and rigid spherical NPs increases with their sizes, due to the increment of their elastic energy change. Furthermore, because of its prominent large contact edge length, the oblate ellipsoid is found to be the least sensitive geometry to the variation in NP‚Äôs elasticity among the spherical, prolate, and oblate shapes during the membrane wrapping. In addition, simulation results indicate that conflicting experimental observations on the efficiency of cellular uptake of elastic NPs could be caused by their different mechanical properties. Our simulations provide a detailed mechanistic understanding about the influence of NPs‚Äô size, shape, and elasticity on their membrane wrapping efficiency, which serves as a rational guidance for the design of NPbased drug carriers.},

  abstract = {Phase separation and cellular organization             Cells are compartmentalized to allow distinct processes to occur in membrane-delimited organelles. But similar spatial restriction of cellular components in membrane-less intracellular assemblies or condensates also appears to occur‚Äîmuch like oil droplets in water. These compartments contribute to multiple biological processes and regulatory mechanisms. Shin and Brangwynne review the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that result in formation of these structures. They explain known and potential functions of such structures in a range of examples, from signaling and local control of biochemical reactants to spatial segregation. In disease, such aggregation may go awry and contribute to neurodegenerative syndromes associated with inappropriate protein aggregation.                            Science               , this issue p.               eaaf4382                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Living cells contain distinct subcompartments to facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of biological reactions. In addition to canonical membrane-bound organelles such as secretory vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, there are many organelles that do not have an enclosing membrane yet remain coherent structures that can compartmentalize and concentrate specific sets of molecules. Examples include assemblies in the nucleus such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles and also cytoplasmic structures such as stress granules, P-bodies, and germ granules. These structures play diverse roles in various biological processes and are also increasingly implicated in protein aggregation diseases.                                         ADVANCES               A number of studies have shown that membrane-less assemblies exhibit remarkable liquid-like features. As with conventional liquids, they typically adopt round morphologies and coalesce into a single droplet upon contact with one another and also wet intracellular surfaces such as the nuclear envelope. Moreover, component molecules exhibit dynamic exchange with the surrounding nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. These findings together suggest that these structures represent liquid-phase condensates, which form via a biologically regulated (liquid-liquid) phase separation process. Liquid phase condensation increasingly appears to be a fundamental mechanism for organizing intracellular space. Consistent with this concept, several membrane-less organelles have been shown to exhibit a concentration threshold for assembly, a hallmark of phase separation. At the molecular level, weak, transient interactions between molecules with multivalent domains or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are a driving force for phase separation. In cells, condensation of liquid-phase assemblies can be regulated by active processes, including transcription and various posttranslational modifications. The simplest physical picture of a homogeneous liquid phase is often not enough to capture the full complexity of intracellular condensates, which frequently exhibit heterogeneous multilayered structures with partially solid-like characters. However, recent studies have shown that multiple distinct liquid phases can coexist and give rise to richly structured droplet architectures determined by the relative liquid surface tensions. Moreover, solid-like phases can emerge from metastable liquid condensates via multiple routes of potentially both kinetic and thermodynamic origins, which has important implications for the role of intracellular liquids in protein aggregation pathologies.                                         OUTLOOK               The list of intracellular assemblies driven by liquid phase condensation is growing rapidly, but our understanding of their sequence-encoded biological function and dysfunction lags behind. Moreover, unlike equilibrium phases of nonliving matter, living cells are far from equilibrium, with intracellular condensates subject to various posttranslational regulation and other adenosine triphosphate‚Äìdependent biological activity. Efforts using in vitro reconstitution, combined with traditional cell biology approaches and quantitative biophysical tools, are required to elucidate how such nonequilibrium features of living cells control intracellular phase behavior. The functional consequences of forming liquid condensates are likely multifaceted and may include facilitated reaction, sequestration of specific factors, and organization of associated intracellular structures. Liquid phase condensation is particularly interesting in the nucleus, given the growing interest in the impact of nuclear phase behavior on the flow of genetic information; nuclear condensates range from micrometer-sized bodies such as the nucleolus to submicrometer structures such as transcriptional assemblies, all of which directly interact with and regulate the genome. Deepening our understanding of these intracellular states of matter not only will shed light on the basic biology of cellular organization but also may enable therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disease by targeting intracellular phase behavior.                                                   Liquid phase condensation: An emerging paradigm of cellular organization.                   Living cells contain various types of condensed liquid-like structures enriched with a distinct set of biomolecules that assemble through regulated phase separation. Sequence-encoded physicochemical properties lead to rich intracellular phase behaviors, including multiphase structuring and emergence of solid-like states from metastable liquids. Liquid condensates affect the flow of information in the cell, often through affecting RNA transcription and protein translation.                                                                         ,              Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nonliving matter, and recent discoveries have shown that they also play a key role within living cells. Intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation is thought to drive the formation of condensed liquid-like droplets of protein, RNA, and other biomolecules, which form in the absence of a delimiting membrane. Recent studies have elucidated many aspects of the molecular interactions underlying the formation of these remarkable and ubiquitous droplets and the way in which such interactions dictate their material properties, composition, and phase behavior. Here, we review these exciting developments and highlight key remaining challenges, particularly the ability of liquid condensates to both facilitate and respond to biological function and how their metastability may underlie devastating protein aggregation diseases.},

  abstract = {Lipid membranes are integral building blocks of living cells and perform a multitude of biological functions. Currently, molecular simulations of cellular-scale membrane remodeling processes at atomic resolution are extremely difficult, due to their size, complexity, and the large timesscales on which these processes occur. Instead, elastic membrane models are used to simulate membrane shapes and transitions between them and to infer their properties and functions. Unfortunately, an efficiently parallelized open-source simulation code to do so has been lacking. Here, we present TriMem, a parallel hybrid Monte Carlo simulation engine for triangulated lipid membranes. The kernels are efficiently coded in C++ and wrapped with Python for ease-of-use. The parallel implementation of the energy and gradient calculations and of Monte Carlo flip moves of edges in the triangulated membrane enable us to simulate large and highly curved membrane structures. For validation, we reproduce phase diagrams of vesicles with varying surface-to-volume ratios and area difference. We also compute the density of states to verify correct Boltzmann sampling. The software can be used to tackle a range of large-scale membrane remodeling processes as a step toward cell-scale simulations. Additionally, extensive documentation make the software accessible to the broad biophysics and computational cell biology communities.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, several models have been proposed to study the flow of fluid-filled bodies.           ,              With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, among others, many scientists have invested significant efforts to model the flow of these fluid-filled bodies. Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods. For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice Boltzmann method due to its specific ability to treat time- and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary: fluid‚Äìstructure and fluid‚Äìfluid methods. The fluid‚Äìstructure methods are characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid‚Äìstructure-based methods into two subcategories, those which treat the fluid‚Äìstructure boundary as a continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid‚Äìfluid methods, particularly useful for the simulations of fluid‚Äìfluid interfaces. We focus on models for immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.},

In lipid membranes research, particle-based molecular simulations are a powerful tool alongside continuum theory, lipidomics, and model, in vitro, and in vivo experiments. Molecular simulations can provide precise and reproducible spatiotemporal (atomic- and femtosecond-level) information about membrane structure, mechanics, thermodynamics, kinetics, and dynamics. Yet the simulation of lipid membranes can be a daunting task, given the uniqueness of lipid membranes relative to conventional liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces, the immense and complex thermodynamic and statistical mechanical theory, the diversity of multiscale lipid models, limitations of modern computing power, the difficulty and ambiguity of simulation controls, finite size effects, competitive continuum simulation alternatives, and the desired application, including vesicle experiments and biological membranes. These issues can complicate an essential understanding of the field of lipid membranes, and create major bottlenecks to simulation advancement. In this article, we clarify these issues and present a consistent, thorough, and user-friendly framework for the design of state-of-the-art lipid membrane MD simulations. We hope to allow early-career researchers to quickly overcome common obstacles in the field of lipid membranes and reach maximal impact in their simulations.},

It has been conjectured that the internal topology of the constituent particles, such as polymers, can cause glassiness too. However, the conjecture relies on immobilizing a fraction of the particles and is therefore difficult to fulfill experimentally. Here we show that in dense solutions of circular polymers containing (active) segments of increased mobility, the interplay of the activity and the topology of the polymers generates an unprecedented glassy state of matter. The active isotropic driving enhances mutual ring threading to the extent that the rings can relax only in a cooperative way, which dramatically increases relaxation times. Moreover, the observed phenomena feature similarities with the conformation and dynamics of the DNA fibre in living nuclei of higher eukaryotes.},

Using His-tagged fluorescent proteins, we are able to precisely control the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle membranes. By fine-tuning this curvature, we obtain dumbbell-shaped vesicles with closed membrane necks as well as neck fission and complete vesicle division. Our results demonstrate that the spontaneous curvature generates constriction forces around the membrane necks and that these forces can easily cover the force range found in vivo. Our approach involves only one species of membrane-bound proteins at low densities, thereby providing a simple and extendible module for bottom-up synthetic biology.},

A classic example of this is the first cell-fate decision of the mouse embryo, where interior cells become inner cell mass and exterior cells become trophectoderm. Fluorescent labelling, imaging, and quantification of tissue-specific proteins have advanced our understanding of this dynamic process. However, instances arise where these markers are either not available, or not reliable, and we are left only with the cells‚Äô spatial locations. Therefore, a simple, robust method for classifying interior and exterior cells of an embryo using spatial information is required. Here, we describe a simple mathematical framework and an unsupervised machine learning approach, termed insideOutside, for classifying interior and exterior points of a three-dimensional pointcloud, a common output from imaged cells within the early mouse embryo. We benchmark our method against other published methods to demonstrate that it yields greater accuracy in classification of nuclei from the pre-implantation mouse embryos and greater accuracy when challenged with local surface concavities. We have made MATLAB and Python implementations of the method freely available. This method should prove useful for embryology, with broader applications to similar data arising in the life sciences.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Cells organize membrane-less internal compartments through a process called liquid‚Äìliquid phase separation (LLPS) to create chemically distinct compartments, referred to as condensates, which emerge from interactions among biological macromolecules. These condensates include various cytoplasmic structures such as P-granules and stress granules. However, an even wider array of condensates subcompartmentalize the cell nucleus, forming liquid-like structures that range from nucleoli and Cajal bodies to nuclear speckles and gems. Phase separation provides a biophysical assembly mechanism underlying this non-covalent form of fluid compartmentalization and functionalization. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we term these phase-separated liquids that organize the nucleus the liquid nucleome; we discuss examples of biological phase transitions in the nucleus, how the cell utilizes biophysical aspects of phase separation to form and regulate condensates, and suggest interpretations for the role of phase separation in nuclear organization and function.},

The cross-linking process endows the polymer matrix with a chemical ‚Äòmemory‚Äô, such that the target molecules can subsequently be recognized by the matrix. We present a simple model that accounts for the key features of this molecular recognition. Using a combination of analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the model can account for the binding of rigid particles to an imprinted polymer matrix with valence-limited interactions. We show how the binding multivalency and the polymer material properties affect the efficiency and selectivity of molecular imprinting.

Although membrane shape deformation by proteins at thermal equilibrium has been extensively studied, nonequilibrium dynamics have been much less explored. Recently, chemical reaction propagation has been experimentally observed in plasma membranes. Thus, it is important to understand how the reaction‚Äìdiffusion dynamics are modified on deformable curved membranes. Here, we investigated nonequilibrium pattern formation on vesicles induced by mechanochemical feedback between membrane deformation and chemical reactions, using dynamically triangulated membrane simulations combined with the Brusselator model. We found that membrane deformation changes stable patterns relative to those that occur on a non-deformable curved surface, as determined by linear stability analysis. We further found that budding and multi-spindle shapes are induced by Turing patterns, and we also observed the transition from oscillation patterns to stable spot patterns. Our results demonstrate the importance of mechanochemical feedback in pattern formation on deforming membranes.},

In some of these phenomena, pattern formation on the membranes is induced by the coupling between membrane deformation and the reaction-diffusion system through curvature-inducing proteins that bend the biological membranes. Although the membrane shape and the dynamics of the curvature-inducing proteins affect each other in these systems, the effect of such mechanochemical feedback loops on the waves has not been studied in detail. In this study, reaction-diffusion waves coupled with membrane deformation are investigated using simulations combining a dynamically triangulated membrane model with the Brusselator model extended to include the effect of membrane curvature. It is found that the propagating wave patterns change into nonpropageting patterns and spiral wave patterns due to the mechanochemical effects. Moreover, the wave speed is positively or negatively correlated with the local membrane curvature depending on the spontaneous curvature and bending rigidity. In addition, self-oscillation of the vesicle shape occurs, associated with the reaction-diffusion waves of curvature-inducing proteins. This agrees with the experimental observation of GUVs with a reconstituted Min system, which plays a key role in the cell division of               Escherichia coli               .

  abstract = {The Brownian motion (BM) is not only a natural phenomenon but also a fundamental concept in several scientific fields. The mathematical description of the BM for students of various disciplines is most often based on Langevin‚Äôs equation with the Stokes friction force and the random force modeling Brownian particle (BP) collisions with surrounding molecules. For many phenomena, such a description is insufficient, as it assumes an infinitesimal correlation time of random force. This shortcoming is overcome by the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which is now one of the most widely used equations in physics. In the present work, we offer a simple way of solving this equation, consisting of its transformation into an integro-differential equation for the mean square displacement of the BP, which is then effectively solved using the Laplace transform (LT). We demonstrate the use of this method to solve both the standard Langevin equation and the GLE for the BP in an external harmonic field. We analyze the cases of overdamped (when frictional forces prevail over inertial forces and the BP mass is considered zero in the equation) and underdamped (inertial effects are not neglected) equations. We show under what conditions an overdamped solution can be used instead of complicated solutions of the underdamped equation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of the LT on a microscopic approach to the derivation of the GLE. Graduate students are offered several problems in which the internal shortcomings of the overdamped Langevin equations manifest themselves.},

On the other hand, when the least-squares function is very flat, the algorithm may easily become lost in parameter space. We introduce several improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to improve both its convergence speed and robustness to initial parameter guesses. We update the usual step to include a geodesic acceleration correction term, explore a systematic way of accepting uphill steps that may increase the residual sum of squares due to Umrigar and Nightingale, and employ the Broyden method to update the Jacobian matrix. We test these changes by comparing their performance on a number of test problems with standard implementations of the algorithm. We suggest that these two particular challenges, slow convergence and robustness to initial guesses, are complimentary problems. Schemes that improve convergence speed often make the algorithm less robust to the initial guess, and vice versa. We provide an open source implementation of our improvements that allow the user to adjust the algorithm parameters to suit particular needs.},

  abstract = {Current theories on the conformation and dynamics of unknotted and non-concatenated ring polymers in melt conditions describe each ring as a tree-like double-folded object. While evidence from simulations supports this picture on a single ring level, other works show pairs of rings also thread each other - a feature overlooked in the tree theories. Here we reconcile this dichotomy using Monte-Carlo simulations of the ring melts with different bending rigidity. We find that rings are double-folded (more strongly for stiffer rings) on and above the entanglement length scale, while the threadings are localized on smaller scales. The different theories disagree on the details of the tree structure, i.e the fractal dimension of the backbone of the tree. In the stiffer melts we find an indication of a self-avoiding scaling of the backbone, while more flexible chains do not exhibit such a regime. Moreover, the theories commonly neglect threadings, and assign different importance to the impact of the progressive constraint release (tube dilation) on single ring relaxation due to the motion of other rings. Despite each threading creates only a small opening in the double-folded structure, the threading loops can be numerous and their length can exceed substantially the entanglement scale. We link the threading constraints to the divergence of the relaxation time of a ring, if the tube dilation is hindered by pinning a fraction of other rings in space. Current theories do not predict such divergence and predict faster than measured diffusion of rings, pointing at the relevance of the threading constraints in unpinned systems as well. Revision of the theories with explicit threading constraints might elucidate the validity of the conjectured existence of topological glass.},

Many biological processes involve dynamic reshaping of membranes, usually mediated by proteins. This interaction works both ways: while proteins influence the membrane shape, the membrane shape affects the interactions between the proteins. To study these membrane-mediated interactions on closed and anisotropically curved membranes, we use colloids adhered to ellipsoidal membrane vesicles as a model system. We find that two particles on a closed system always attract each other, and tend to align with the direction of largest curvature. Multiple particles form arcs, or, at large enough numbers, a complete ring surrounding the vesicle in its equatorial plane. The resulting vesicle shape resembles a snowman. Our results indicate that these physical interactions on membranes with anisotropic shapes can be exploited by cells to drive macromolecules to preferred regions of cellular or intracellular membranes, and utilized to initiate dynamic processes such as cell division. The same principle could be used to find the midplane of an artificial vesicle, as a first step towards dividing it into two equal parts.},

Arguably, one of the biggest hurdles that researchers are facing now is the assembly of different modules of cell function inside a single container. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) have emerged as a suitable container with many methods available for their production. Well‚Äêstudied swelling‚Äêbased methods offer a wide range of lipid compositions but at the expense of limited encapsulation efficiency. Emulsion‚Äêbased methods, on the other hand, excel at encapsulation but are only effective with a limited set of membrane compositions and may entrap residual additives in the lipid bilayer. Since the ultimate artificial cell will need to comply with both specific membrane and encapsulation requirements, there is still no one‚Äêmethod‚Äêfits‚Äêall solution for GUV formation available today. This review discusses the state of the art in different GUV production methods and their compatibility with GUV requirements and operational requirements such as reproducibility and ease of use. It concludes by identifying the most pressing issues and proposes potential avenues for future research to bring us one step closer to turning artificial cells into a reality.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The interplay of membrane proteins is vital for many biological processes, such as cellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction between nerve cells. Theoretical considerations have led to the idea that the membrane itself mediates protein self-organization in these processes through minimization of membrane curvature energy. Here, we present a combined experimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions directly for the first time. In our experimental model system we control the deformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles. Using confocal microscopy, we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive interaction force leading to reversible binding. The attraction extends over 2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal energy (‚àí3.3\,k               B               T). Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured interaction is independent of length scale. Our combined experimental and numerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for interactions between any membrane-deforming objects, from nanometre-sized proteins to micrometre-sized particles.},

Treadmilling filaments appear to be moving, even though individual proteins remain static. Here, we investigate the role of treadmilling, implemented as dynamic turnover, in the collective filament self-organisation. On the example of the bacterial FtsZ protein, a highly conserved tubulin homologue, we show, in computer simulations and             in vitro             experiments, that treadmilling drives filament nematic ordering by dissolving misaligned filaments. We demonstrate that ordering via local dissolution allows the system to quickly respond to chemical and geometrical biases in the cell, and is necessary for the formation of the FtsZ ring required for bacterial cell division in living             Bacillus subtilis             cells. We finally use simulations to quantitatively explain the characteristic dynamics of FtsZ ring formation             in vivo             . Beyond FtsZ and other cytoskeletal filaments, our study identifies a novel mechanism for nematic ordering via constant birth and death of energy-consuming filaments.},

  abstract = {The process of osmosis, a fundamental phenomenon in life, drives water through a semipermeable membrane in response to a solute concentration gradient across this membrane. In vitro, osmotic shocks are often used to drive shape changes in lipid vesicles, for instance, to study fission events in the context of artificial cells. While experimental techniques provide a macroscopic picture of large-scale membrane remodeling processes, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool to study membrane deformations at the molecular level. However, simulating an osmotic shock is a time-consuming process due to slow water diffusion across the membrane, making it practically impossible to examine its effects in classic MD simulations. In this article, we present Shocker, a Python-based MD tool for simulating the effects of an osmotic shock by selecting and relocating water particles across a membrane over the course of several pumping cycles. Although this method is primarily aimed at efficiently simulating volume changes in vesicles, it can also handle membrane tubes and double bilayer systems. Additionally, Shocker is force field-independent and compatible with both coarse-grained and allatom systems. We demonstrate that our tool is applicable to simulate both hypertonic and hypotonic osmotic shocks for a range of vesicular and bilamellar setups, including complex multicomponent systems containing membrane proteins or crowded internal solutions.},

The package is motivated to provide dynamic thermostats to extend implicit-solvent coarse-grained (IS-CG) models by incorporating kinetic contributions from the solvent to facilitate their use in a wider range of applications. To capture the thermal and hydrodynamic contributions of the solvent to dynamics, we introduce momentum conserving thermostats and computational methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics and the stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian method (SELM). SELM couples the coarse-grained microstructure degrees of freedom to continuum stochastic fields to capture both the relaxation of hydrodynamic modes and thermal fluctuations. Features of the SELM software include (i) numerical time-step integrators for SELM fluctuating hydrodynamics in inertial and quasi-steady regimes, (ii) Lees‚ÄìEdwards-style methods for imposing shear, (iii) a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up models and simulations, (iv) standardized XML formats for parametrization and data output, and (v) standardized formats VTK for continuum fields and microstructures. The SELM software package facilitates for pre-established models in LAMMPS easy adoption of the SELM fluctuating hydrodynamics thermostats. We provide here an overview of the SELM software package, computational methods, and applications.},

We also study degenerate and secondary bifurcations related to Wilton‚Äôs ripples in the traveling case, and explore the breakdown of self-similarity at the crests of extreme standing waves. In shallow water, we find that standing waves take the form of counterpropagating solitary waves that repeatedly collide quasi-elastically. In deep water with surface tension, we find that standing waves resemble counter-propagating depression waves.

  date = {2020},
  abstract = {Fitting models to data is critical in many science and engineering fields. A major task in fitting models to data is to estimate the value of each parameter in a given model. Iterative methods, such as the Gauss-Newton method and the LevenbergMarquardt method, are often employed for parameter estimation in nonlinear models. However, practitioners must guess the initial value for each parameter in order to initialize these iterative methods. A poor initial guess can contribute to nonconvergence of these methods or lead these methods to converge to a wrong solution. In this paper, an initial guess free method is introduced to find the optimal parameter estimators in a nonlinear model that minimizes the squared error of the fit. The method includes three algorithms that require different level of computational power to find the optimal parameter estimators. The method constructs a solution interval for each parameter in the model. These solution intervals significantly reduce the search space for optimal parameter estimators. The method also provides an empirical probability distribution for each parameter, which is valuable for parameter uncertainty assessment. The initial guess free method is validated through a case study in which Fick‚Äôs second law is fit to an experimental data set. This case study shows that the initial guess free method can find the optimal parameter estimators efficiently. A four-step procedure for implementing the initial guess free method in practice is also outlined.},
